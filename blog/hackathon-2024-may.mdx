Building on the success of last October's Hacktoberfest, we are excited to announce a global week-long hackathon from May 18th to 24th, focused on leveraging Instill Cloud to tackle real-world challenges. This time, Instill AI will join forces with [Numbers Protocol](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/) to enable builders to create responsible AI applications using blockchain and C2PA content provenance. In conjunction with this, we will also host a complementary local workshop in Taiwan on May 18th to deepen participants' engagement and learning.

In this blog post, we will guide you on participating in these exciting events and making the most of your contributions. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner looking to get involved, we have something for everyone. So let's dive in and discover how you can join the Hackathon fun!

Note that the workshop and Hackathon are independent events; attending one does not necessitate participation in the other.

## How to Participate?

For both the Hackathon and Workshop, registration is required for all attendees. Participants interested in the Hackathon must register via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/FFwmcndgSHeHYhmy8), while those attending the local workshop should register through [Accupass](https://www.accupass.com/event/2404260318129443163600).

Registered participants for either event will receive **2,500 Instill Credits** to fully leverage the capabilities of Instill Cloud. For builders looking to integrate C2PA and blockchain provenance into their generative AI content, a Capture account powered by Numbers Protocol is required prior to the hackathon. You can find detailed instructions in this [article](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/blog/how-to-create-traceable-generative-ai). After registering, you will receive **12 free NUM credits** to add content provenance in the Instill Cloud.

Let's take a closer look at what 2,500 Instill Credits entail. With GPT-3.5 Turbo as our reference,  users can harness the power equivalent to 2.5 million input tokens and 2.5 million output tokens. To put this into perspective, according to OpenAI, [1,500 words translate roughly to 2048 tokens](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them). Hence, 2.5 million tokens correspond to approximately 1.8 million words. With such a substantial word count, you can engage GPT-3.5 Turbo extensively, generating vast amounts of content or conducting comprehensive analyses. 
Alternatively, shifting our gaze towards GPT-4, utilizing 2,500 Instill Credits grants access to 55,555 input tokens and 55,555 output tokens.  Consequently, 55,555 tokens roughly correspond to 40,690 words, allowing you to leverage the capabilities of GPT-4 within this word limit.
Additionally, the 12 free NUM credits from Numbers Protocol enable you to create a C2PA watermark with blockchain proof for up to 120 files.
