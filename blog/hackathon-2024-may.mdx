## How to Participate?

For both the Hackathon and Workshop, registration is required for all attendees. Participants interested in the Hackathon must register via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/FFwmcndgSHeHYhmy8), while those attending the local workshop should register through [Accupass](https://www.accupass.com/event/2404260318129443163600). Registered participants for either event will receive 2,500 Instill Credits to fully leverage the capabilities of Instill Cloud. It’s important to note that the workshop and Hackathon are independent events; attending one does not necessitate participation in the other.

Let's take a closer look at what 2,500 Instill Credits entail. With GPT-3.5 Turbo as our reference,  users can harness the power equivalent to 2.5 million input tokens and 2.5 million output tokens. To put this into perspective, according to OpenAI, [1,500 words translate roughly to 2048 tokens](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them). Hence, 2.5 million tokens correspond to approximately 1.8 million words. With such a substantial word count, you can engage GPT-3.5 Turbo extensively, generating vast amounts of content or conducting comprehensive analyses.

Alternatively, shifting our gaze towards GPT-4, utilizing 2,500 Instill Credits grants access to 55,555 input tokens and 55,555 output tokens.  Consequently, 55,555 tokens roughly correspond to 40,690 words, allowing you to leverage the capabilities of GPT-4 within this word limit.

## **Begin Building**

Explore the flexibility of Instill Cloud by creating applications with no limitations on type. Here are two directions for inspiration:

1. **Mimic Existing Features**: Consider replicating features like Arc’s "ask on page" capability, demonstrating potential and utility.
2. **Solve Real-world Problems**: Use AI to address practical challenges, adding value and relevance to your creations.

### **Inspiration Examples:**

- **[Webpage 5 sec previews](https://instill.tech/instill-wombat/pipelines/jumbotron-webpage-5-sec-previews)**: This pipeline scrapes a webpage and generates a summary, mimicking [Arc Max](https://arc.net/max)'s "5 Second Previews" functionality.
- **[Ask on page](https://instill.tech/instill-wombat/pipelines/jumbotron-ask-on-page)**: This pipeline responds to queries about a webpage’s content, replicating [Arc Max](https://arc.net/max)'s "Ask on Page" functionality.
- **[From AI to BI: Transforming Business Intelligence](https://instill.tech/instill-wombat/pipelines/bi-pipeline)**: Leverage Large Language Model (LLM) to interact with business revenue reports, offering insights and recommendations for informed decision-making.

## **Submission Guidelines**

Before submitting, ensure your project adheres to these rules:

- **Instill Cloud Integration:** Each project must use at least one Instill Cloud pipeline. Make sure to share your pipeline link and code(if any) on GitHub.
- **Public Accessibility:** Set your Instill Cloud pipeline and GitHub project to public visibility.

### **Steps to Submit**

1. **GitHub Project Setup:** Create a GitHub project under your account with a README detailing the real-life problem your application solves, and include a URL to the project pipeline.
2. **Final Submission:** Submit your completed projects, including the pipeline link and GitHub page, along with any supplementary materials (texts, slides, videos, etc.) through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/q1TvcftekZ9WxpjL7) before the Hackathon concludes.
