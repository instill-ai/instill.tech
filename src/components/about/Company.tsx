        Instill AI was founded with the vision of easing the difficulties of AI
        product development, driven by a shared understanding of the
        complexities involved in AI development. The company recognizes that
        unstructured data ETL is crucial but often overlooked in the modern data
        stack. Despite many companies claiming to be data-driven, they usually
        focus on structured data, neglecting the fact that 80% of the
        world&apos;s data is unstructured and challenging to analyze. This gap
        in capability is precisely where Instill AI comes in, as many companies
        lack the knowledge or resources to effectively manage unstructured data.
        In August 2022, Instill AI achieved a significant milestone by
        introducing the Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP), an open-source,
        modularized ETL infrastructure specifically designed to address the
        challenges of unstructured data. This launch reinforced the
        company&apos;s dedication to democratizing AI access and exemplified
        their ongoing commitment to overcoming obstacles in AI development for
        the benefit of all.
