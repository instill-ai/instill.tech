          We&#39;re looking for passionate and dedicated early members to build
          open-source and highest-quality products for solving a challenging
          issue in the modern data stack. You&#39;ll be joining the founding
          team to establish its strong foundation from the very beginning.

        <p className="text-instillGrey90 text-instill-body-normal">
          This is a great opportunity for those who want to build their career
          with a fast-growing startup at zero to one stage. It is also a
          position for those who value learning for the long term above earning
          in the short term. Your colleagues are a bunch of super self-motivated
          AI missionaries and data tooling practitioners. You will impact the
          company direction and help Instill AI build its strong foundation and
          shape its open-source community.
