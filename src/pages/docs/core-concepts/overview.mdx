Modern data stack misses unstructured visual data processing.

**Visual data preparation (VDP)** is to fill in the missing piece. At a high-level perspective, VDP streamlines visual data from a data source to a computer vision model processing (or deep learning inferencing) to a data destination.

In other words, VDP is a tool to extract, transform and load (ETL) unstructured visual data to their structured forms.

To benefit a broader set of users and maximise the tool's usability and affordability, VDP is built with an open heart to make the most of open source software in each component:

## Pipeline

**Pipeline** consists of **Source**, **Model** and **Destination**, altogether defined in a `recipe`. One pipeline defines one processing unit for a certain [CV Task](cv-task). A pipeline can be in either `SYNC` or `ASYNC` mode, depending on whether the pipeline task is time-critical or not. See [Pipeline](pipeline) for more details.

**Pipeline** is maintained in [pipeline-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend).

## Source

**Source** is the component at the beginning of a VDP pipeline, which streams unstructured visual data (e.g., images, videos) from IoT devices (e.g., IP cameras) or cloud storage services (e.g., GCP Cloud Storage, AWS S3).

In the VDP project, the unstructured data source connectors are developed and maintained by the Instill AI community.

**Source** is maintained in [connector-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend).

## Model

**Model** is the core component to process the unstructured visual data to solve a certain [CV Task](core-concepts/cv-task). VDP uses [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) under the hood to optimise AI model inference for various frameworks including TensorRT, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, Python, and more.

VDP uses `model definition` to abstract a model source (i.e., codebase) so the users can adopt different appraoches to import models. Different appraoches can provide different features. For example, some approaches support version control but some do not. It is up to the users to adopt appraoch they are already familiar with. We strive to support as many popular model sources as possible. See [Model Definition](../models/definitions/overview.md) for more details.

**Model** is maintained in [model-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-backend).

## Destination

Destination is the component at the end of a VDP pipeline, which loads the structured data provided by the Model component to a target destination.

VDP implements [Airbyte Protocol](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol) to adopt Airbyte's 30+ destination connectors to write the structured data result from **Model** to the destination. VDP users can thus directly benefit from the abundant community resources from there to further perform data movement or transformation.

**Destination** is maintained in [connector-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend).
