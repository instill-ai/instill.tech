A pipeline is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of components to process visual data. It is defined by a `recipe` which is essentially a JSON object:

```json
{
  "source": <source-connector-resource-name>,
  "model_instances": [
    <model-instance-resource-name>,
    ...
  ],
  "destination": <destination-connector-resource-name>
}
```

A `recipe` describes a pipeline resource consisting of:

- `source` - where the pipeline starts to ingest image/video data to be processed
- `model_instances` - a number of deployed Vision AI models to process the ingested visual data in parallel to generate structured outputs
- `destination` - where to send the structured outputs

Depending on the use case, the user can create a pipeline in `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, or `FETCH` mode. The pipeline mode is determined by the combination of selected source and destination. Continue to read for more details.

## SYNC mode

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously. The result is sent back to the user right after the data is processed by **Model**. This mode is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern.
The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

</p>

To create a `SYNC` pipeline, both source and destination needs to be configured with the same type of protocol. VDP supports HTTP and gRPC for a `SYNC` pipeline.

For example, this `recipe` defines a gRPC `SYNC` pipeline for real-time YOLOv7 inference:

```json
{
  "source": "source-connectors/source-grpc",
  "model_instances": ["models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu"],
  "destination": "destination-connectors/destination-grpc"
}
```

## ASYNC mode

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs asynchronous workload. The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response.
Once the data has been processed by **Model**, the result is sent to the data destination. This mode is for use cases that do not require inference results immediately.

  <img src="/docs-assets/core-concepts/async.svg" alt="ASYNC pipeline mode" />
</p>

To create an `ASYNC` pipeline, the source can be either HTTP or gRPC, and the destination can be any Airbyte destination connectors.

For example, this `recipe` defines an`ASYNC` pipeline to detect images by YOLOv7 via HTTP request and write the structured detection output into a PostgreSQL database:

```json
{
  "source": "source-connectors/source-http",
  "model_instances": ["models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu"],
  "destination": "destination-connectors/postgres"
}
```

## FETCH mode

A pipeline in the `FETCH` mode performs scheduled workload to regularly fetch data from the **Source** to send to **Model** for inference and write to destination in the end.

</p>

`FETCH` mode support is coming soon.
