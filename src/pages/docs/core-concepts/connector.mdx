At the two ends of a VDP pipeline, there are source connector (i.e., the E in ETL) and destination connector (i.e., the L in ETL).

## Definition

## Source

A source connector is in charge of ingesting unstructured visual data into **Pipeline**.

VDP supports HTTP and gRPC source connector for both `SYNC` and `ASYNC` pipelines.

Source connectors for the pipeline [`FETCH`](core-concepts/pipeline#fetch-mode) mode are coming soon.

## Destination

A destination connector is to write the standardised CV Task output from **Model** to the destination data warehouse or notification.

VDP supports HTTP and gRPC destination connector for the `SYNC` pipeline.

For the `ASYNC` pipeline, VDP adopts [Airbyte Protocol](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol) to inject standardised CV Task output from **Model** into the [AirbyteRecordMessage](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#airbyterecordmessage) JSON object, to employ Airbyte destination connectors.

Specifically, to trigger a destination connector's container [`write`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#write) operation, `connector-backend` assembles the [ConfiguredAirbyteCatalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/beginners-guide-to-catalog/#configuredairbytecatalog) on the fly, with the corresponding connector configuration JSON object used in [`check`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#check) operation, to start a Temporal workflow to write the structured data to the destination.

As far as [Airbyte connections and sync modes](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/connections) are concerned, VDP currently supports `full_refresh` sync mode and `append` destination sync mode for an `ASYNC` pipeline.

VDP currently does not support Airbyte's [Namespaces](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/namespaces).

## State

## Release stage

#### Source connectors

Instill AI develops and maintains source connectors. We use release stage below to indicate a source connector's readiness:

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha**               | An alpha source connector indicates the connector is under development and Instill AI is collecting its early feedback and issues reported by early adopters. We strongly discourage using alpha source connectors for production.                                     |
| **Beta**                | A beta source connector is considered stable and reliable with no further backwards incompatible changes but has not been validated by a broader group of users. We expect to find and fix a few issues and bugs in the release before it is ready for the next stage. |
| **Generally Available** | A generally available source connector has been thoroughly tested in the battlefield and is ready for use in a production environment. Its documentation is considered sufficient to support widespread adoption.                                                      |

#### Destination connectors

Destination connectors are developed and maintained by Airbyte community, where the release stage of each Airbyte destination connector is reported [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/#destinations).
