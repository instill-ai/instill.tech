CV tasks, a.k.a Vision tasks, focus on analysing and understanding the content of visual data in the same way as human visual system does.
The goal is to make a computer/device provide description for the data as complete and accurate as possible.
Some classic CV tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation and keypoint detection.
These primitive tasks are the foundation for building many real-world industrial vision applications.

VDP support by importing the state-of-the-art CV models to solve a certain CV task:

- **Image classification** - classify images into predefined categories
- **Object detection** - detect and localize multiple objects in images
- **Keypoint detection** - detect and localize multiple keypoints of objects in images

## Image classification

Image

## Object detection

## Keypoint detection

## What if my task is not supported by VDP?
