We've made it easy to get started with VDP either on demo playground, or on your machine.

:::info
If you got 10s, don't hesitate to give us a ⭐ on [GitHub](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) to support the VDP project.
:::

## Online demo playground

Visit [demo.instill.tech](https://demo.instill.tech) for the easiest way to try out VDP.

## Run VDP locally

### Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose (compose file version: `3.9`) to run all services at local. Please install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before using VDP.

### Deploy VDP

:::info
Downloading the Triton server image will take a while, but it should be just a one-time effort.
:::

Get started locally by running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git
$ cd vdp
$ make all
```

Once the services are up, the UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
