VDP automatically load a [`.env`](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/.env) file that contains key/value pairs defining required environment variables.
You can customize the file based on your configuration.

## Configuring services

VDP services uses [Koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) library for configuration. It supports loading configuration from multiple sources and make it available to the service.
To override the default configuration file, you can set the corresponding environment variable in the [Compose](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file in VDP.
All configuration environment variables for each service are prefixed with `CFG_`.

Read the default configuration files for a full overview of all supported configuration options of each service:
[`mgmt-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/mgmt-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml),
[`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml),
[`model-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml) and
[`pipeline-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml).

**Configuring VDP service version**

Set the environment variable for a specific service to determine which version to use in VDP.

```make .env
# Set the version of individual VDP service
CONSOLE_VERSION=<console-version>
MGMT_BACKEND_VERSION=<mgmt-backend-version>
CONNECTOR_BACKEND_VERSION=<connector-backend-version>
MODEL_BACKEND_VERSION=<model-backend-version>
PIPELINE_BACKEND_VERSION=<pipeline-backend-version>

# Set the version of 3rd party tools
TRITON_SERVER_VERSION=<triton-server-version>
REDIS_VERSION=<redis-version>
POSTGRESQL_VERSION=<postgresql-version>
TEMPORAL_VERSION=<temporal-version>
TEMPORAL_UI_VERSION=<temporal-ui-version>
```

The combination of default versions in `.env` file is fully tested for compatibility.
Unless you are debugging and testing, updating the default versions in `env` file is discouraged.

**Configuring VDP domain**

Set the domain name to access VDP by overriding the environment variable `DOMAIN`:

```make .env
DOMAIN=<domain-name-to-access-vdp>
```

Without setting `DOMAIN`, the default domain is `localhost`.

## Anonymised Usage Collection

To help us better understand how VDP is used and can be improved, VDP collects and reports _Anonymised_ usage statistics.

#### What data is collected

> **We value your privacy.** So, we went for the annoymous data and selected a set of details to share from your VDP instance that would give us insights about how to improve VDP without being invasive.

When a new VDP is running, the usage client in services including `mgmt-backend`, `connector-backend`, `model-backend` and `pipeline-backend` in VDP will ask for a new session, respectively.
Our usage server returns a token used for future reporting.
For each session, we collect [`Session`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L15-L66) data including some basic information about the service and the system details the service is running on:

- name of the service to collect data from, e.g., `SERVICE_CONNECTOR` for `connector-backend`
- edition of the service to identify the deployment, e.g., `local-ce` for local open-source deployment
- version of the service, e.g., `0.5.0-alpha`
- architecture of the system the service is running on, e.g., `amd64`
- operating system the service is running on, e.g., `linux`
- uptime in seconds to identify the rough life span of the service

Each session is assigned with a random UUID for tracking and identification.
Then, each session will collect and send its own [`SessionReport`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L153-L175) data every one hour:

- [`MgmtUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L68-L72) reports data for `mgmt-backend` session
  - information of the [onboarded User](/docs/start-here/build-your-first-pipeline#onboarding)
- [`ConnectorUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L74-L103) reports data for `connector-backend` session of the onboarded User
  - UUID of the onboarded User
  - number of _connected_ or _disconnected_ Sources
  - number of _connected_ or _disconnected_ Destinations
  - array of `SourceConenctorDefinition` of the Sources
  - array of `DestinationConnectorDefinition` of the Destinations
- [`ModelUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L105-L130) reports data for `model-backend` session of the onboarded User
  - UUID of the onboarded User
  - number of Models that have at least one _online_ Model Instance or have no _online_ Model Instances
  - number of _online_ and _offline_ Model Instances
  - array of `ModelDefinition` of the Models
  - array of CV Tasks of the Model Instances
  - number of processed images for testing models
- [`PipelineUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L132-L151) reports data for `pipeline-backend` session of the onboarded User
  - UUID of the onboarded User
  - number of _active_ and _inactive_ Pipelines
  - number of `SYNC` and `ASYNC` Pipelines
  - number of images processed by the Pipelines

You can check the full usage data structs in [protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto).
These data does not allow us to track Personal Data but enables us to measure session counts and usage statistics.

#### Implementation

The anonymous usage report client library is open-source in [`usage-client`](https://github.com/instill-ai/usage-client).
To limit risk exposure, we keep the usage server implementation private for now.
In summary, the Session data and SessionReport sent from each session get updated in the usage server.

Additionally, The frontend Console sends event data to [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com).

#### Opting out

VDP usage collection helps the entire community. We'd appreciate if you can leave it on.
However, if you want to opt out, you can disable it by overriding the `.env` file:

```make .env
DISABLEUSAGE=true
```

This will disable the VDP usage collection for the entire project.

## Acknowledgements

Our Anonymised usage collection were inspired by KrakenD's [How we built our telemetry service](https://www.krakend.io/blog/building-a-telemetry-service/) and would love to acknowledge that their design has helped us to bootstrap our usage collection project.
