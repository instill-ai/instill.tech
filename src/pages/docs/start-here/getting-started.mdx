**Visual Data Preparation (VDP)** is an open-source visual data ETL tool to streamline the end-to-end visual data processing:

- Extract unstructured visual data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- Transform it into analysable structured data by Vision AI models
- Load the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

## Highlights

- 🚀 The fastest way to build end-to-end visual data pipelines
- ⚡️ High-performing backends implemented in Go
- 🖱️ One-click import & deploy models
- 📦 Standardise structured outputs for computer vision tasks
- 🔌 Pre-built ETL data connectors for extensive data access
- 🪢 Perform in SYNC for real-time inference and ASYNC for on-demand workload
- 🧁 Scalable API-first microservice design for great developer experience
- 🤠 Build for every Vision AI and Data practitioner with no-/low-code interfaces

## Quick start

We've made it easy to get started with VDP either on a local machine or on our demo playground.

### Local run

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose to run all services at local.

Get started locally by running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git
$ cd vdp
$ make all
```
Once the services are up, the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

⚠︎ Downloading the Triton server image will take a while, but it should be just a one-time effort.

To shut down all running services:

```bash
$ make down
```

### Demo playground

Just visit the [demo website](https://demo.instill.tech) to try out VDP.
