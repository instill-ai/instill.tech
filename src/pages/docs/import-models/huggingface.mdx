The `Hugging Face` model definition allows you to import models from a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) repository.

## Supported model tasks

Currently, VDP supports importing models tagged with the following tasks

- ✅ [Image Classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-classification&sort=downloads)

## Release stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

| Field       | Type   | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repo_id`\* | string | A model repo name hosted on the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Valid repo ids can be located at the root-level, or namespaced under a user or organization name, like `google/vit-base-patch16-224` |

## Getting started

### Requirements

- A public Hugging Face model repository that is labelled with `Image classification` task

### No-code setup

To import a model from Hugging Face in the Console, do the following:

1. Go to the **Model** page and click **Add new model**
2. In the **Set Up New Model** page, fill an ID for your model, this will be the unique identifier of this model
3. Click the **Model type** ▾ drop-down and choose **Hugging Face**
4. [Optional] Give a short description of your model in the **Description** field
5. Fill the Hugging Face model ID that stores the model files and click **Setup new model**
6. Once the model is imported, click the **Model instances** ▾ drop-down, pick the `latest` model instance and click **Deploy**
7. Now go to the **Model** page, the corresponding model instance should be online

Since a Hugging Face model has no version control, when the model is successfully imported, the model will has and only has one model instance tagged with `latest`.

### Low-code setup

1. Send a HTTP request to the VDP `model-backend` to import a model from GCS bucket managed by ArtiVC:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models -d '{
  "id": "vit-base-patch16-224",
  "model_definition": "model-definitions/huggingface",
  "configuration": {
    "repo_id": "google/vit-base-patch16-224"
  }
}'
```

2. Deploy the `latest` model instance

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models/vit-base-patch16-224/instances/latest:deploy
```

3. Perform an inference to test the model

<CH.Code>

```shellscript cURL(url)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models/vit-base-patch16-224/instances/latest:test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/dog.jpg"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(base64)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models/vit-base-patch16-224/instances/latest:test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZ...iiigD/2Q=="
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(multipart)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models/vit-base-patch16-224/instances/latest:test-multipart \
--form 'file=@"dog.jpg"'
```

</ CH.Code>

in which `http://localhost:8083` is the `model-backend` default URL.
