No matter where your model stores, we want to keep your models on the same storage without changes and make the process of importing your models into VDP easy.
That's why we integrate VDP with various model platforms and tools as model sources and strive to support as many popular model sources as possible.

A model source in VDP is defined as `model definition`. A `model definition` defines the schema about how to configure and import the model. Currently, VDP supports importing models from the following model definitions:

- [ArtiVC](/docs/import-models/artivc)
- [GitHub](/docs/import-models/github)
  - Track model files using [Git-LFS](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs)
  - Track model files using [DVC](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-manage-large-model-files-by-dvc)
- [Hugging Face](/docs/import-models/huggingface)
- [Local](/docs/import-models/local)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new model definition**, you can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/issues), or request it in the #vdp channel of our [community](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
