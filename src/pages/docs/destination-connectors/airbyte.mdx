## Description

An Airbyte destination connector paired with any source connector defines an `ASYNC` or `FETCH` pipeline. 

An Airbyte destination connector is in `CONNECTED` state only when its configuration is valid to connect with the destination. Otherwise, the state will be either `ERROR` or `UNSPECIFIED`.

## Release stage

Please refer to the Airbyte [Destinations Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/#destinations) table.

## Configuration

Please refer to each Airbyte [Destinations](https://docs.airbyte.com/category/destinations) for configuration details.
