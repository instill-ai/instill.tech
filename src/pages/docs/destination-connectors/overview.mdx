A destination connector is to write the standardised **CV Task** output from **Model** to the destination data warehouse or notification.

A destination connector in VDP is defined by [`DestinationConnectorDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/connector_definition.proto#L126-L149) 
which defines the basic properties of a destination connector, of which the inner field [`connector_definition.spec.connection_specification`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/spec.proto#L43-L45) 
defines the connector configuration JSON Schema.

Currently, VDP supports destination connectors:

- [HTTP](/docs/destination-connectors/http)
- [gRPC](/docs/destination-connectors/grpc)
- [Airbyte Destination Connectors](/docs/destination-connectors/airbyte-destination-connector)

If you'd like to **ask for a new source connector**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions), or request it in the **#vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
