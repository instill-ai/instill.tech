![VDP model definition integration](/docs-assets/model-definitions.svg)

A `model definition` represents a source from which models are imported and defines what inputs are used to configure the model. VDP supports importing models from different sources:

- [ArtiVC](/docs/models/definitions/artivc)
- [GitHub](/docs/models/definitions/github)
  - Track model files using [Git-LFS](/docs/models/definitions/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs)
  - Track model files using [DVC](/docs/models/definitions/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-manage-large-model-files-by-dvc)
- [Hugging Face](/docs/models/definitions/huggingface)
- [Local](/docs/models/definitions/local)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new model definition**, you can create a issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/issues), or request it in the #vdp channel of our [community](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
