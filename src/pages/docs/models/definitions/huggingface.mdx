## Getting started

### Requirements

- A public Hugging Face model repository that is labelled with `Image classification` task

### Setup guide

Go to the model tab and click `Add new model`. Since a Hugging Face model has no version control, when the model is successfully imported, the model will has and only has one model instance tagged with `latest`.

1. Pick a name for your model, this will be the unique identifier of this model
2. Select `Hugging Face` from the drop-down list
3. Upload the model zip file and click Setup new model
