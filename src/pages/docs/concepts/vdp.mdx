**Visual Data Preparation (VDP)** is an open-source visual data ETL tool to streamline the end-to-end visual data processing pipeline:

1. Extract unstructured visual data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
2. Transform it into analysable structured data by Vision AI models
3. Load the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

# Why we build VDP

Before we started to build VDP, we had fought with streaming large volume data (billions of images a day!) to automate vision tasks using deep learning-based computer vision, sweating blood to build everything from scratch.

We've learned that model serving for an effective end-to-end data flow concerns not only **high throughput** and **low latency** but also **cost efficiency**, and these criteria are non-trivial to achieve altogether. Nonetheless, we had successfully built a battle-proven model serving system in-house and have the system run in production for years.

What we had built can actually be modularised into working components to be generalised to a broader spectrum of vision tasks and industry sectors. We think it's about time to share the experiences and to extend the system to make Vision AI more accessible to everyone.

The goal of VDP is to seamlessly bring Vision AI into the modern data stack with a standardised framework. Check our blog post [Missing piece in modern data stack: visual data preparation](https://blog.instill.tech/visual-data-preparation/?utm_source=doc&utm_medium=doc&utm_campaign=doc) on how this tool can make a significant impact on unstructured visual data processing across different stakeholders.
