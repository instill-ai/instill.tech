In this tutorial, we will build our first unstructured data pipeline with VDP, which allows you to process your data for a specific AI task with minimum effort.

As we demonstrated in [VDP 101 - Introduction](/tutorials/vdp-101-1-introduction?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline), VDP aims to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data pipeline.
An unstructured data pipeline is defined by a recipe which consists of:

- `source` component - where the pipeline starts to ingest unstructured data to be processed
- `model` components - a number of deployed AI models to process the ingested unstructured data in parallel and generate meaningful outputs
- `destination` components - a number of destinations to send the processed outputs in parallel

The following tutorial will demonstrate how to set up these three components and build a `SYNC` pipeline for **Object Detection** with YOLOv7 via Console.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the details, please ensure you have launched VDP on your machine. If not, you can set it up following the tutorial [VDP 101 [2/7] Launch VDP on your local machine](/tutorials/vdp-101-2-quickstart/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline).

After launching VDP, you can access the Console via http://localhost:3000. If this is your first time setting up VDP, you should see the onboarding page. Enter your email, and you are all set!

## Step 1: Create a new pipeline

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. Since we have not yet set up any pipeline, this page will be empty. To create our first pipeline via VDP Console, click the **Add new pipeline** button.

  alt="Empty pipeline list page of the VDP Console."
/>

## Step 2: Add an HTTP source

VDP currently supports two sources, **HTTP** and **gRPC**. An HTTP source accepts HTTP requests with payloads to be processed by a pipeline.

  Connectors](/docs/latest/vdp/operators/start/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline).
</InfoBlock>

To set up a **Source Connector**,

1.  click the **Pipeline mode** â–¾ drop-down and choose `Sync`,
2.  click the **Source type** â–¾ drop-down and choose `HTTP`, and
3.  click **Next**.

  alt="Add an HTTP source to set up a SYNC pipeline in the VIP Console."
/>

## Step 3: Import and deploy a model from GitHub

To fulfil objective detection tasks, we import a model from our public GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc).

To set it up,

1.  give your model a unique ID,
2.  add a description (optional),
3.  click the **Model source** â–¾ drop-down and choose `GitHub`,
4.  fill in the GitHub repository URL `instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc` and the corresponding Git tag: use `v1.0-cpu` to deploy on CPU or `v1.0-gpu` to deploy on GPU
5.  click **Set up** to fetch the AI model to VDP.

  alt="Import a model from a GitHub repository via VDP Console."
/>

Check out the [documentation](/docs/latest/model/import/github/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline).

## Step 4: Add an HTTP destination

Since we are building a `SYNC` pipeline, the `HTTP` destination is paired automatically with the `HTTP` source as we set up for the source. Click **Next**.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/3-create-your-first-pipeline/add-a-sync-destination-http.png"
  alt="Add an HTTP destination to create a SYNC pipeline in the VDP Console."
/>

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

When creating pipelines under `sync` mode, source and destination connectors in VDP must be the same, which means:

- HTTP source â†’ HTTP destination
- gRPC source â†’ gRPC destination

</InfoBlock>

## Step 5: Set up the pipeline

We are almost there! We have created `Source`, `Model`, and `Destination`. The last step is to give this pipeline an ID, and we are ready to go! Just

1.  give your pipeline a unique ID `vdp-101-sync`,
2.  add a description (optional), and
3.  click **Set up**.

  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/3-create-your-first-pipeline/first-pipeline.png"
  alt="Set up a pipeline in the VDP Console."
/>

ðŸŽ‰ CONGRATULATIONS! You have your first VDP pipeline setup. You should see it on the **Pipeline** page.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/3-create-your-first-pipeline/first-pipeline-list.png"
  alt="Find your first pipeline on the Pipeline page."
/>

You can find further details about this pipeline by clicking on the one you just created.
The **green** light indicates the pipeline is `Active` and can be triggered via sending HTTP requests.
It may take a while to see the status indicator turning green since deploying the model and activating the pipeline require time.

  the pipeline states.

## What's next?

You may notice the REST request examples to trigger the pipeline in the **Trigger** section at the bottom of the page. No worry about this now. You will learn how to trigger this pipeline in the following tutorial â†’ [VDP 101 [4/7] How to trigger a SYNC pipeline?](/tutorials/vdp-101-4-how-to-trigger-a-sync-pipeline/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline).
