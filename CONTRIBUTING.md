## How to contribute to instill.tech (especially docs, tutorials and blog)

We adapt single framework structure to serve all our content enabled by the Next.js ability of serving web page with different strategy. Including static site generation, server-site generation and incremental static site generation.

## General guidelines for Docs, Tutorials and Blog

### Folder structure

There have three content folders and their corresponding page, assets folder.

- Docs folder has nested structure, by default it will accept all kinds of nested structure and compile the path into url. For example. A file in /docs/start-here/getting-started.mdx will be compiled into https://instill.tech/docs/start-here/getting-started.
- Blog and tutorials currently only accept **flat** structure. This means it won't accept nested folder strcture likes /tutorial/nested-folder/foo.mdx.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ blog

## Caveats

### Nested p tag issue

Please don't use p tag to wrap other component in markdown. Because it will cause nested p tag issue.

```mdx
// This is not allowed.
<p>
  <ZoomableImg />
</p>
```
