## About

**⚗️ Instill Model** is an advanced MLOps/LLMOps platform and a key component of
the **🔮 Instill Core** suite, designed to address the challenges of developing
and deploying deep learning models for unstructured data ETL. It provides robust
model serving, orchestration and monitoring capabilities, enabling efficient
management and deployment of machine learning models.

As part of the full-stack AI solution offered by **🔮 Instill Core**, **⚗️
Instill Model** works in conjunction with **💧 Instill VDP** and **💾 Instill
Artifact**. This means that **⚗️ Instill Model** can be used as either a
standalone scalable and robust model serving solution, or in tandem with **💧
Instill VDP** to leverage your own custom models and create bespoke AI
workflows.
