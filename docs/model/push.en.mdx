To upload a model image to **⚗️ Instill Model**, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of the Instill `python-sdk`:

```bash
pip install instill-sdk
```

2. Then, log in to Docker on the `Instill Core` instance:

```bash
# for Instill Cloud
docker login api.instill.tech
# username: USER_ID
# password: API_TOKEN

# for a local Instill Core instance
docker login localhost:8080
# username: admin
# password: API_TOKEN
```

The `USER_ID` and `API_TOKEN` correspond to the user namespace and the API token
the user has generated.

3. Now you can upload the model to **⚗️ Instill Model**:

```bash
# for Instill Cloud
instill-push -t VERSION_TAG -u api.instill.tech

# for a local Instill Core instance
instill-push -t VERSION_TAG -u localhost:8080
```

4. Once you see the following message, the model image has been successfully
   uploaded:

```text
2024-05-23 23:05:03,484.484 INFO     [Instill Builder] USER_ID/MODEL_ID:VERSION_TAG  pushed
2024-05-23 23:05:03,485.485 INFO     [Instill Builder] Done
```

The `USER_ID`, `MODEL_ID` and `VERSION_TAG` correspond to the user namespace,
the ID and version tag of the model.

As the model image is uploaded, **⚗️ Instill Model** will automatically allocate
the necessary resources for your model and deploy it. Depending on the size of
the model image, and the type of hardware specified for the model, it could take
some time for the model to go online. In the console, you can select the
`Versions` tab under your model namespace to see the current state of the model
version. To learn more about the different states a model version can assume,
please refer to the [Model State](state) page.

Now, you can refer to [Model Inference](inference) on how to run an inference.
