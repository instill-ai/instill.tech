The `GitHub` model definition allows you to import models from a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. Your model files can be tracked with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or [DVC](https://dvc.org/).

## Feature

Currently, Instill Model supports importing models from

- âœ… Public GitHub repository
- ðŸš§ Private GitHub repository (coming soon)

## Release Stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

| Field          | Type   | Note                                                                |
| :------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `repository`\* | string | Name of a public GitHub repository, e.g., `instill-ai/model-yolov7` |

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A public GitHub repository where model files are stored
- The repository has at lease one tag

### Prepare a GitHub Repository and Track Large Model Files by Git LFS

GitHub limits the size of files ([max 100 MB](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-size-limits)) allowed in repositories. But the size of the model files can be large. To track large model files beyond the limit, you can use [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage).

Assume Git LFS is [installed](https://git-lfs.github.com/), this guideline publishes model files in a repository on GitHub.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
In general, importing models via this approach is not recommended. GitHub has limited quotas of storage and bandwidth for Git LFS files, and the usage will count against the repository owner's quotas leading you to purchase more when reaching the cap.

Instead, consider using GitHub DVC or ArtiVC approaches.

</InfoBlock>

**Step 1: Create a GitHub repository**

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new _public_ repository and set up on the command line

```shellscript
# Create a folder
mkdir model-yolov7
cd model-yolov7

# Set a new remote
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Replace `https://github.com/user/repo.git` with your repository's remote URL.

**Step 2: Download sample model data**

Having initialized the project, let's download the sample model files

```shellscript
# Download sample model
curl -o yolov7.zip https://artifacts.instill.tech/vdp/sample-models/yolov7.zip
tar -xvf yolov7.zip
rm yolov7.zip
```

The extracted model files should look like:

```shellscript
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ model.onnx    // <--- large model file
â””â”€â”€ model.py
```

In this case, we use the Object Detection model [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) as sample data. Among all model files, the size of `model.onnx` is 141 MB that beyonds the GitHub file uploading limit.

**Step 3: Track large files with Git LFS**

To associate a file type with Git LFS, enter `git lfs track` followed by the name of the file extension.

```shellscript
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Associate onnx files to Git LFS
git lfs track "*.onnx"

# List the currently tracked paths
git lfs track
# Output
Listing tracked patterns
    *.onnx (.gitattributes)
Listing excluded patterns
```

This commands amends the repository's `.gitattributes` file and associates every `.onnx` files with Git LFS.

```
*.onnx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

Then, let's push all the other files to GitHub as you normally would:

```shellscript
#  Update remote
git add --all
git commit -m "feat: add model files"

# List Git LFS tracked paths
git lfs ls-files
# Output
1881fe9c50 * model.onnx

# Update remote
git push -u origin main
```

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

As the [official GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage) suggested, please commit the local `.gitattributes` file into your repository.

</InfoBlock>

After uploading all files successfully, go to your GitHub repository. You should see all model files are uploaded with the `.onnx` file in Git LFS.

  alt="Show YOLOv4 tracked by Git LFS"
/>

**Step 4: Create a Git tag**

Git tags mark specific points in the repository's history. They are deployable software iterations for share and re-use.
When importing a model from a GitHub repository, Instill Model creates one model according to the specified tag.

```shellscript
git tag <tagname>
git push origin --tags
```

ðŸŽ‰ This repository is ready. Follow the [Import](#import) and import the repository to Instill Model.

### Prepare a GitHub Repository and Manage Large Model Files by DVC

Besides Git LFS, a good alternative is to use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) within a Github repository.

> By using DVC, you can be sure not to bloat your repositories with large volumes of data or huge models. These large docs-assets reside in the cloud or other remote storage locations. You will simply track their version info in Git.
>
> â€”â€” From DVC [doc](https://dvc.org/doc/studio/user-guide/prepare-repositories#prepare-your-repositories)

**Supported DVC remote storage**

- âœ… Public Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Assuming DVC is [installed](https://dvc.org/doc/install), this guideline publishes a repository on GitHub and uploads tracked large model files remotely with DVC.

Follow **Step 1-2** of the [Prepare a GitHub repository and track large model files by Git LFS](#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs) guideline.

**Step 1: Create a GitHub repository**

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new _public_ repository and set up on the command line

```shellscript
# Create a folder
mkdir model-yolov7
cd model-yolov7

# Set a new remote
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Replace `https://github.com/user/repo.git` with your repository's remote URL.

**Step 2: Download sample model data**

Having initialized the project, let's download the sample model files

```shellscript
# Download sample model
curl -o yolov7.zip https://artifacts.instill.tech/vdp/sample-models/yolov7.zip
tar -xvf yolov7.zip
rm yolov7.zip
```

**Step 3: Initialize DVC in the repository**

```shellscript
dvc init
```

A few [DVC internal directories and files](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files) are created. Let's track them with Git.

```shellscript
git status

# Output
...
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
	new file:   .dvc/config
	new file:   .dvcignore

git commit -m "chore: initialize DVC"
```

**Step 4: Track large model files with DVC**

Let's use `dvc add` to track the ONNX model file:

```shellscript
dvc add model.onnx

# Output
To track the changes with git, run:

  git add model.onnx.dvc .gitignore
  ...
```

DVC stores the model file information in a `.dvc` metadata file and lists it in `.gitignore`. The `.dvc` file is a placeholder for the original large file.

```shellscript
cat model.onnx.dvc

# Output
outs:
- md5: 304ebe08d8a00e9cb03147b756e26d3a
  size: 147727196
  path: model.onnx
```

`dvc add` moves the large file into `.dvc/cache`:

```shellscript
.dvc/cache
â””â”€â”€ 30
    â””â”€â”€ 4ebe08d8a00e9cb03147b756e26d3a
```

The hash value of the ONNX file we just added (`2e0eeb4...`) determines the above cache path.

Follow the instruction and track these files with Git

```shellscript
git add model.onnx.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "feat: add model file"
```

**Step 5: Push the large model files to DVC remote storage**

Currently, Instill Model supports fetching models from public Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Let's set up the [remote storage location with a public GCS bucket](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/add#google-cloud-storage):

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

Prepare the GCS bucket:

- [Create a storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) before adding DVC remote
- Make sure to run `gcloud auth application-default login` or other ways to authenticate and access GCS.

</InfoBlock>

```shellscript
# Create a new data remote
dvc remote add -d myremote gs://my-public-bucket/yolov7

# Record changes
git add .dvc/config
git commit -m "chore: set up dvc remote storage"
```

Instead of storing the DVC-tracked large files in the repository, we can store them remotely (usually with a cloud storage service) with `dvc push`.

```shellscript
dvc push
```

dvc push copies the local cached data to the remote storage we set up earlier. The remote bucket directory should look like:

```shellscript
.../yolov7
â””â”€â”€ 30
    â””â”€â”€ 4ebe08d8a00e9cb03147b756e26d3a
```

Let's push all files including dvc files to GitHub

```shellscript
git add --all
git commit -m "feat: add model files"
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 6: Create a Git tag**

Follow **Step 4** of the [Prepare a GitHub repository and track large model files by Git LFS](#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs) guideline and tag the current model.

```shellscript
git tag <tagname>
git push origin --tags
```

ðŸŽ‰ If you've followed the above steps to store the model in remote storage and version it within a GitHub repository using [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/basic-concepts/dvc-project#dvc-repository), just run the setup guide below, Instill Model will import the model accordingly.

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">
  Use `dvc pull` to retrieve DVC-tracked files from remote storage. See
  [here](https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-management?tab=Mac-Linux#retrieving) for
  more information.

## Import

### No-code Setup

To import a model from GitHub in the Console, do the following:

1. Go to the **Model** page and click **Add new model**
2. In the **Set Up New Model** page, fill an ID for your model, this will be the unique identifier of this model
3. [Optional] Give a short description of your model in the **Description** field
4. Click the **Model source** â–¾ drop-down and choose **GitHub**
5. Fill the GitHub repository URL and the Git tag that stores the model files and click **Set up**
6. Now go to the **Model** page, the corresponding model should be there. Note that it may take some time for the model to be deployed online.

### Low-code Setup

1. Send a HTTP request to the Instill Model `model-backend` to import a model from a GitHub repository.

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model/v1alpha/users/admin/models \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_***' \
--data '{
  "id": "yolov7-v1-cpu",
  "model_definition": "model-definitions/github",
  "configuration": {
    "repository": "instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc",
    "tag": "v1.0-cpu"
  }
}'
```

2. Deploy the imported model `yolov7-v1-cpu`.

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model/v1alpha/users/admin/models/yolov7-v1-cpu/deploy \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_***'
```

3. Perform an inference to test the model

<CH.Code>

```shellscript cURL(url)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model/v1alpha/users/admin/models/yolov7-v1-cpu/trigger \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_***' \
--data '{
    "task_inputs": [
        {
            "classification": {
                "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/dog.jpg"
            }
        },
        {
            "classification": {
                "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/bear.jpg"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(base64)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model/v1alpha/users/admin/models/yolov7-v1-cpu/trigger \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_***' \
--data '{
    "task_inputs": [
        {
            "classification": {
                "image_base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZ...iiigD/2Q=="
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(multipart)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/model/v1alpha/users/admin/models/yolov7-v1-cpu/trigger-multipart \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_***' \
--form 'file=@"dog.jpg"'
```

</ CH.Code>

## Limitations

Current implementation does not support real-time GitHub sync: after you import a model from a specific tag of a GitHub repository, new releases of this GitHub tag won't be synced in Instill Model.
