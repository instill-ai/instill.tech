The first step in creating your own model resource in **‚öóÔ∏è Instill Model** is to
initialise a model namespace from the **üîÆ Instill Core** or **‚òÅÔ∏è Instill
Cloud** console. Follow the steps below to create an empty model namespace for
your model:

1. Initiate by selecting `+ Create Model` on your model page.
2. Configure
   - **Owner**: Determine whether the model will reside under your personal
     account or your organization's account.
   - **Model ID**: Input a name for your model namespace.
   - **Description**: Optionally, provide a description to offer more context
     about the model.
   - **Visibility**: Decide if you prefer your model to be public or private.
   - **AI Task**: Choose the type of [AI Task](ai-task) this model will execute.
   - **Cloud Region**: Select which cloud provider and which region the model
     will be hosted on.
   - **Hardware**: Choose the hardware type this model will operate on, cost
     will vary.
