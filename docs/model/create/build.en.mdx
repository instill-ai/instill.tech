To build a model image for **‚öóÔ∏è Instill Model**, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest Python **üì¶ Instill SDK**:

```bash
pip install instill-sdk
```

2. Within your custom model [directory](prepare#model-layout), run the `build`
   command with your user ID, model ID and optional model version tag:

```bash
instill build USER_ID/MODEL_ID -t VERSION_TAG
```

Note that the model version tag will default to `latest` if not supplied.

3. After you see similar outputs as below, the image building process finished
   successfully:

```text
2024-05-28 01:54:44,404.404 INFO     [Instill Builder] USER_ID/MODEL_ID:VERSION_TAG built
2024-05-28 01:54:44,423.423 INFO     [Instill Builder] Done
```

The `USER_ID`, `MODEL_ID` and `VERSION_TAG` correspond to the user namespace,
the ID of the model and the version tag of the model.
