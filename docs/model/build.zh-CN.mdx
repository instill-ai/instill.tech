To build a servable model image for **Instill Model**, follow these steps:

## Build Image

1. Install the latest Instill `python-sdk`
```bash
pip install instill-sdk
```
2. Within your custom model [directory](prepare#model-layout), run the `build` command with your desired model version tag
```bash
instill_build -t {your-image-tag}
```
3. After you see similar outputs as below, the image building process finished successfully
```bash
2024-05-28 01:54:44,404.404 INFO     [Instill Builder] {user_id}/{model_id}:{tag} built
2024-05-28 01:54:44,423.423 INFO     [Instill Builder] Done
```

## Push Image

1. Next, docker login to the `Instill Core` instance
  - `Instill Cloud`
```bash
docker login api.instill.tech
# username: {your-user-id}
# password: {your-api-token}
```
 - self-host `Instill Core`
```bash
docker login localhost:8080
# username: admin
# password: {your-api-token}
```

2. Now we can push the model onto `Instill Core` instance
  - self-host `Instill Core`
```bash
instill_push -t {your-image-tag} -u localhost:8080
```
  - `Instill Cloud`
```bash
instill_push -t {your-image-tag} -u api.instill.tech
```
3. After seeing the following message, the model image has been successfully pushed
```bash
2024-05-23 23:05:03,484.484 INFO     [Instill Builder] {instill-core-url}/{user_id}/{model_id}:{tag} pushed
2024-05-23 23:05:03,485.485 INFO     [Instill Builder] Done
```

As the model image is pushed, **Instill Model** will automatically allocate the necessary resources for your model and deploy it. Depending on size of the model image, and the type of hardware specified for the model, it could take a while for the model to go online. In the console you can select the `Versions` tab under your model namespace to see the current state.

Now, you can refer to [Use a Model](use) on how to trigger an inference.
