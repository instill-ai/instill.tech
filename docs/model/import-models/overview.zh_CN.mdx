No matter where your model stores, we want to keep your models in the same place without changes and make the process of importing the models into Instill Model very easy.
That's why Instill Model has integrated many model platforms and tools as _model sources_. We strive to support as many popular _model sources_ as possible.

A _model source_ in Instill Model is defined by [`ModelDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/model/model/v1alpha/model_definition.proto). The JSON Schema of a `ModelDefinition` defines how to configure and import a _model source_.
Currently, Instill Model supports importing models using the following sources:

- [ArtiVC](artivc)
- [GitHub](github)
  - Track model files using [Git-LFS](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs)
  - Track model files using [DVC](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-manage-large-model-files-by-dvc)
- [Hugging Face](huggingface)
- [Local](local)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new model definition**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/model/discussions), or request it in the **#model** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
