To prepare pre-processing model in Python, create a Python file with a [structure](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend#usage) similar to below:

```python model.py
import triton_python_backend_utils as pb_utils
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TritonPythonModel(ABC):
    """Your Python model must use the same class name.
    Every Python model that is created must have "TritonPythonModel" as the class name.
    """

    def initialize(self, args):
        """`initialize` is called only once when the model is being loaded.
        Implementing `initialize` function is optional. This function allows
        the model to initialize any state associated with this model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : dict
          Both keys and values are strings. The dictionary keys and values are:
          * model_config: A JSON string containing the model configuration
          * model_instance_kind: A string containing model instance kind
          * model_instance_device_id: A string containing model instance device ID
          * model_repository: Model repository path
          * model_version: Model version
          * model_name: Model name
        """
        print('Initialized...')

    def execute(self, requests):
        """`execute` must be implemented in every Python model. `execute`
        function receives a list of pb_utils.InferenceRequest as the only
        argument. This function is called when an inference is requested
        for this model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        requests : list
          A list of pb_utils.InferenceRequest

        Returns
        -------
        list
          A list of pb_utils.InferenceResponse. The length of this list must
          be the same as `requests`
        """

        responses = []

        # Every Python backend must iterate through list of requests and create
        # an instance of pb_utils.InferenceResponse class for each of them. You
        # should avoid storing any of the input Tensors in the class attributes
        # as they will be overridden in subsequent inference requests. You can
        # make a copy of the underlying NumPy array and store it if it is
        # required.
        for request in requests:
            # Perform inference on the request and append it to responses list...
            response = self.pre_process_batch_request(request)
            responses.append(response)

        # You must return a list of pb_utils.InferenceResponse. Length
        # of this list must match the length of `requests` list.
        return responses

    def finalize(self):
        """`finalize` is called only once when the model is being unloaded.
        Implementing `finalize` function is optional. This function allows
        the model to perform any necessary clean ups before exit.
        """
        print('Cleaning up...')

    @abstractmethod
    def pre_process_batch_request(self, request):
        """`pre_process_batch_request` pre-processes a Triton Inference request
        and outputs a Triton Inference response

        Parameters
        ----------
        request : pb_utils.InferenceRequest
          A Triton Inference Request

        Returns
        -------
        pb_utils.InferenceResponse
          A Triton Inference Response
        """

        raise NotImplementedError(
            f'Implement pre-process function for a Triton Inference request')

```

Follow the above structure and implement the abstract method `pre_process_batch_request` to pre-process the input images in a batch request.
