Docker Compose is the most straightforward way to set up Instill Model in local machines or remote instances.

## Setup

Make sure that Docker Engine and Docker Compose plugin have been installed on your workstation (see the official [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)).

On your workstation, run:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/model.git && cd model
make all
```

Once all services are up and running, the `api-gateway-model` can be accessed at [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080)
and the `console` at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

⚠︎ Downloading the Triton server image will take a while, but it should be just a one-time effort.

## Shutdown

To shutdown and clean up all Instill Model resources, run

```shellscript
make down
```
