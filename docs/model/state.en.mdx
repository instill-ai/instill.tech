A deployed model version can be in these states:

- `STARTING`: Resources are being provisioned.
- `UNSPECIFIED`: The version is undergoing an internal operation.
- `SCALING`: The replica count is adjusting to traffic.
- `ACTIVE`: The replica is servicing requests.
- `IDLE`: No replicas are handling requests, triggering a scale down.
- `OFFLINE`: No active replicas, a cold start will be initiated on the next
  request.

If deployment fails, the version will be in the `ERROR` state.

If the model does not receive any requests for 30 minutes a scale-down will be
triggered, and if the replica count falls to `0`, the model will go `OFFLINE`.
