A deployed model version can assume a number of different states. To check the
status of a model version, select the `Versions` tab from the **Model Overview**
page in the console and view the `Status` field.

To understand these model states, we first need to introduce the concept of a
replica. At runtime, a model version deployment consists of a number of
replicas. These are essentially clones of the model class that are launched in
separate processes. The number of replicas is autoscaled according to the model
traffic. Please refer to the [Ray
Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) documentation for further
information regarding replicas.

The model version can be in one of the following states:

- `STARTING`: Resources are being provisioned.
- `ACTIVE`: The replicas are servicing requests.
- `SCALING`: The replica count is adjusting to traffic.
- `IDLE`: No replicas are handling requests, triggering a scale down.
- `OFFLINE`: No active replicas, a cold start will be initiated on the next
  request.
- `ERROR`: The model version failed to deploy.

where `ACTIVE` and `IDLE` directly refer to the activity of the model version
replicas.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">  
  If an `IDLE` model does not receive any requests for 30 minutes a scale-down
  will be triggered, and if the replica count falls to `0`, the model will go
  `OFFLINE`.
</InfoBlock>

The diagram below illustrates the full model lifecycle, showing the relationship
and transitions between these states when a model version is deployed.

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">  
  If the model state is `ERROR`, there is likely an error in the model
  preparation. Please refer to the [Prepare Model](prepare) section and
  carefully ensure you have correctly followed all of the required steps.
