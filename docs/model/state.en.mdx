A deployed model version can assume one of the following states:

- `STARTING`: Resources are being provisioned.
- `ACTIVE`: The replica is servicing requests.
- `SCALING`: The replica count is adjusting to traffic.
- `IDLE`: No replicas are handling requests, triggering a scale down.
- `OFFLINE`: No active replicas, a cold start will be initiated on the next
  request.
- `ERROR`: The model version failed to deploy.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">  
  If an `IDLE` model does not receive any requests for 30 minutes a scale-down
  will be triggered, and if the replica count falls to `0`, the model will go
  `OFFLINE`.
</InfoBlock>

The diagram below illustrates the relationship and transitions between these
states when a model version is deployed:

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">  
  If the model state is `ERROR`, there is likely an error in the model
  preparation. Please refer to the [Prepare Model](prepare) section and
  carefully ensure you have correctly followed all of the required steps.
