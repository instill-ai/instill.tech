Upon a successful model version deployment, the state of a model version can be `UNSPECIFIED`, `OFFLINE`, `SCALING`, `IDLE` or `ACTIVE`.

- When a model version is undergoing internal operation and is not yet deployed, the state is `UNSPECIFIED`.
- When a model version's number of replica is scaling up or down determined by traffic, the state is `SCALING`.
- When a model version's replica is actively processing requests, the state is `ACTIVE`.
- When none of the model version's replica is processing requests, the state is `IDLE`, and will be in count down to scale down.
- When there is `0` replica of this model version, the state is `OFFLINE`, and it will go through cold boot when the next request come in.

If a model image version is not deployable, the state is `ERROR`.
