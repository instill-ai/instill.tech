<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  **This SDK tool is under active development** For any bug found or feature
  request, feel free to open any issue regarding this SDK tool in our in our
  [community](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core/issues) repo
</InfoBlock>

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pip | Poetry

## Installation

Install it directly into an activated virtual environment:

<CH.Code>

```shellscript pip
pip install instill-sdk
```

```shellscript poetry
poetry add instill-sdk
```

</ CH.Code>

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="warning">
  If your host machine is on arm64 architecture (including Apple silicon
  machines, equipped with m1/m2 processors), there are some issues when
  installing `grpcio` within `conda` environment. You will have to manually
  build and install it like below. Read more about this issue
  [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/33714).
</InfoBlock>

```shellscript
GRPC_PYTHON_LDFLAGS=" -framework CoreFoundation" pip install grpcio --no-binary :all:
```

### Check Import

After installation, you can check if it has been installed correctly:

```shellscript
python
>>> import instill
>>> instill.__version__
```

### Config Instill Core or Instill Cloud Instance

Before we can start using this SDK, you will need to properly config your target instance. We support two ways to setup the configs, which are

#### Config file

Create a config file under this path `${HOME}/.config/instill/sdk/python/config.yml`, and within the file you will need to fill in some basic parameters for your desired host.[^1]

[^1]: You can obtain an `api_token`, by simply going to Settings > API Tokens page from the console, no matter whether it is `Instill Core` or `Instill Cloud`.

Within the config file, you can define multiple instances with the `alias` of your liking. Later in the SDK you can refer to this `alias` to switch between instances.[^2]

[^2]: SDK will look for alias `default` first. If it is not found, it will load the config for the first alias in the config file.

```yaml
hosts:
  alias1:
    url:    str
    secure: bool
    token:  str
  alias2:
    url:    str
    secure: bool
    token:  str
  ...
  ...
```

Example:

```yaml
hosts:
  default:
    url: localhost:8080
    secure: false
    token: instill_sk***
  cloud:
    url: api.instill.tech
    secure: true
    token: instill_sk***
```

#### At runtime

If you do not like the idea of having to create a config file, you can also setup your target instance by doing the following at the very beginning of your script.

```python
from instill.configuration import global_config

global_config.set_default(
    url="api.instill.tech",
    token="instill_sk***",
    secure=True,
)
```

## Usage

### Create Client

Simply import the `get_client` function to get the client that are connected to all services with the config you setup previously.

```python
from instill.clients import get_client

client = get_client()
```

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Remember to call `client.close()` at the end of script to release the channel
  and the underlying resources.
</InfoBlock>

If you have not set up `Instill VDP` or `Instill Model`, you will get a warning like this:

```bash
2023-09-27 18:49:04,871.871 WARNING  Instill VDP is not serving, VDP functionalities will not work
2023-09-27 18:49:04,907.907 WARNING  Instill Model is not serving, Model functionalities will not work
```

You can check the readiness of each service:

```python
client.mgmt_service.is_serving()
# True
client.pipeline_service.is_serving()
# True
client.model_service.is_serving()
# True
```

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Depends on which project(`Instill VDP` or `Instill Model` or both) you had
  launched locally, some services might not be available.
</InfoBlock>

After making sure all desired services are serving, we can check the user status by:

```python
client.mgmt_service.get_user()
```

If you have a valid `api_token` in your config file, you should see something like this:

```
name: "users/admin"
uid: "4767b74d-640a-4cdf-9c6d-7bb0e36098a0"
id: "admin"
