### Instill VDP

💧 **Instill VDP**, or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, is a robust data orchestrator tailored to address unstructured data ETL challenges.
It is to streamline processing unstructured data from diverse sources, such as AI applications, cloud or on-premises storage systems, and IoT devices.
By leveraging AI models and incorporating custom logic, VDP facilitates the transformation of raw data into insightful and actionable formats. 
Additionally, it loads the processed data into data warehouses, applications, or any desired destinations.
VDP enables building flexible and durable pipelines, with features like failover mechanisms, automatic retries, rate limiting, and batching to handle high-volume data straight out of the box.

For those seeking to integrate AI into their applications, VDP provides a comprehensive solution.
Users can seamlessly connect their data with a variety of AI models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision, Audio, and other specialized models.
Moreover, VDP enables users to incorporate custom data transformation logic into their pipelines, facilitating the creation of tailored workflows.
Additionally, users can visually test these pipelines with a single click,  monitor each stage of the output, and share their pipelines to demonstrate their work, thus fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the organization or the wider public.
