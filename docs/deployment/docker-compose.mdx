Docker Compose is the most straightforward way to setup VDP in local machines or remote instances.

:::info{type=info}
Instructions in this page have been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04.
:::

## Setup

Make sure that Docker Engine and Docker Compose plugin have been installed on your workstation (see the official [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)).

On your workstation, run:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
make all
```

Once all services are up and running, the `api-gateway` can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
and the `console` at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Shutdown

To shutdown and clean up all VDP resources, run

```shellscript
make down
```
