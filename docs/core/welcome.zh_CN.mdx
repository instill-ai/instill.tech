Welcome to the Instill Core documentation!
This guide will help you get started with Instill Core and Instill Core, empowering you to build AI-first applications effortlessly.

## Instill Core: foundation for AI-first applications

**Instill Core** serves as the bedrock for AI-first applications.
With Instill Core, you gain access to source-available [Base](#base-essential-services-for-vdp-and-model), [Model](#model-the-modelops-platform) and [VDP](#versatile-data-pipeline-vdp) products, enabling you to construct AI pipelines for unstructured data.

## Instill Core: a fully-managed public core service

☁️ Instill Core is a fully-managed public core service that complements Instill Core perfectly.
It provides the easiest and most reliable way to access VDP and Model, while offering several advantages, including:

- **Painless Setup**: Getting started is a breeze
- **Maintenance-Free Infrastructure**: We handle the backend, allowing you to focus solely on your AI applications
- **Production-Ready Services**: Serve your applications with stability and reliability
- **Flexible Pricing**: Start for free and pay as you grow

👉 [Try Instill Core today](https://console.instill.tech/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=23q2-instill-core-launch) by following our step-by-step [guidelines](/getting-started).
The service is currently in **Open Alpha** testing phase, and all features are FREE during this period.

## Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)

[**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) is a source available unstructured data infrastructure tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline:

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as AI applications, core/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- **Transform** unstructured data into analysable or meaningful data representations using AI models
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

Getting started with VDP is easy, whether you choose to deploy it through Instill Core or self-host it via Instill Core.
Learn more about [VDP deployment](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview) in our documentation.

## Model: The ModelOps Platform

[**Model**](https://github.com/instill-ai/model), also known as **Instill Model**, is a cutting-edge ModelOps platform.
It empowers you to import and serve Machine Learning (ML) models for inference.
Like other Instill products, Model is also source-available.
To deploy your ML models effectively, check out [how to deploy Model](/docs/model/deployment/overview).

## Base: Essential Services for VDP and Model

[**Base**](https://github.com/instill-ai/base), also referred to as **Instill Base**, is a fundamental component that hosts essential services, including user management servers, databases, and third-party observability tools.
Base lays the groundwork for launching VDP and Model seamlessly.
Additionally, it incorporates [Console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console), a user-friendly web-based UI application that enhances the accessibility of VDP and Model.
