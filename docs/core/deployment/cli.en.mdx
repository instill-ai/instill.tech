## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - `inst` works on macOS or Linux, but does not support
  Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - **üîÆ Instill Core** uses Docker Compose to run
  all services at local. See the official
  [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) and the [Docker
  Resource Requirements for Instill
  Core](../deployment#docker-resource-requirements).

## Downloading ‚å®Ô∏è Instill CLI

`inst` is available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

<CH.Code>
```shellscript Install
brew install instill-ai/tap/inst
```

```shellscript Upgrade
brew upgrade inst
```

</CH.Code>

Alternatively, `inst` supports cross platforms. You can just download the **‚å®Ô∏è
Instill CLI** for your operating system from [the Assets of the release
page](https://github.com/instill-ai/cli/releases/latest):

- MacOS x86_64/amd64
- Linux x86_64/amd64
- Linux arm64/aarch64
- Linux arm-v6
- Windows x86_64/amd64

If you do download from the above links, the steps are slightly different
compared to downloading the CLI from Homebrew. After downloading the CLI, you
will have to make it executable. Let's take **‚å®Ô∏è Instill CLI** on MacOS for
example:

```shellscript
## Download **‚å®Ô∏è Instill CLI** binary file from the latest release version.
## Here we use `v0.1.0-alpha` as example
wget https://github.com/instill-ai/cli/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/inst_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz

## unpack the file
tar -zxvf inst_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz

cd bin

chmod +x inst

## Run the ‚å®Ô∏è Instill CLI
./inst
```

The following command will check all available commends:

```shellscript

Once the **‚å®Ô∏è Instill CLI** has been installed, you can deploy a local **üîÆ
Instill Core** instance:

```shellscript

```

Once all services are up and running,the Console UI is ready to go at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Please proceed by following the
[onboarding guide](../../quickstart#Authorisation).
