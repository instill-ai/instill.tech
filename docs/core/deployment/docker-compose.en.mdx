Docker Compose is the a straightforward way to set up Instill Core in local machines or remote instances.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Instructions on this page have been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04.
  Nevertheless, we strongly recommend using our auto-deployment tool, [Instill
  CLI](cli), for the deployment process.
</InfoBlock>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - Instill Core works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - Instill Core uses Docker Compose to run all services at local. See the official [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
  and the [Docker Resource Requirements for Instill Core](../deployment#docker-resource-requirements).

## Setup

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="WARNING">
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the
  next release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version,
  use the [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/base/releases) instead.
</InfoBlock>

On your workstation, run:

<VersionCore>
```shellscript
git clone -b -version- https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core.git && cd instill-core 
make all 
```
</VersionCore>


Once all services are up and running,the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Proceed by following the [authorisation guide](../../quickstart#Authorisation).

## Shutdown

To shutdown and clean up all Instill Core resources, run

```shellscript
make down
```
