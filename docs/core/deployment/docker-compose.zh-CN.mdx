Docker Compose is the a straightforward way to set up **ðŸ”® Instill Core** in
local machines or remote instances.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Instructions on this page have been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04.  
</InfoBlock>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - **ðŸ”® Instill Core** works on macOS or Linux, but does not
  support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - **ðŸ”® Instill Core** uses Docker Compose to run
  all services at local. See the official
  [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) and the [Docker
  Resource Requirements](../deployment#docker-resource-requirements).

## Setup

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="warning">
  {" "}
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the next
  release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version, use the
  [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/base/releases) instead.{" "}
</InfoBlock>

On your workstation, run:

<VersionCore>
  ```bash 
  git clone -b -version-
  https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core.git && cd instill-core make all
  ```
</VersionCore>

Once all services are up and running,the Console UI is ready to go at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Proceed by following the
[authorisation guide](../../quickstart#Authorisation).

## Shutdown

```
