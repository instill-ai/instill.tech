## About the Project

The modern data stack lacks unstructured data processing capabilities,
presenting significant challenges in connecting diverse data sources, developing
and deploying deep learning models, and maintaining resilient, high-performing
pipelines. **🔮 Instill Core** addresses these issues by providing a scalable
solution that integrates AI models with the modern data stack, offering
end-to-end infrastructure tools that streamline the entire process. This makes
AI accessible and effective for everyone, bridging the gap that previously
required extensive in-house, non-scalable efforts.

**🔮 Instill Core** encompasses multiple subprojects that together form
a full-stack AI solution, including

- **💧 [Instill VDP](#-instill-vdp)**,
- **⚗️ [Instill Model](#%EF%B8%8F-instill-model)**,
- **💾 [Instill Artifact](#-instill-artifact-coming-soon)**, and
- **⚙️ [Instill Component](#%EF%B8%8F-instill-component)**.

The project also comes with a web-based UI application known as **📺 [Instill
Console](#-instill-console)**, which offers a user-friendly, no-code and
drag-and-drop pipeline builder for effortless pipeline creation and enhanced
real-time and historical observability of pipeline runs. Users have the option
to interact with **🔮 Instill Core** through the **⌨️ [Instill
CLI](#-instill-cli)** and can integrate it using the **📦 [Instill
SDK](#-instill-sdk)**.

## 💧 Instill VDP

**VDP** stands for **Versatile Data Pipeline**. The foundation of **💧 Instill
VDP** lies in the concept of a highly flexible, extensible, and versatile
pipeline that can handle a variety of data modalities by connecting and using
various components (see ⚙️ [Instill Component](#%EF%B8%8F-instill-component) section).

The implementation is in the
[pipeline-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend) repository.

## ⚗️ Instill Model

Processing unstructured data is akin to a chicken-and-egg conundrum. AI models
require data for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, while the data
processing itself necessitates effective AI models. These two elements are
mutually dependent and often interwoven in real-world applications. **⚗️ Instill
Model** is responsible for managing MLOps/LLMOps services. Its role includes
serving, fine-tuning, and monitoring models to ensure consistent performance in
unstructured data ETL processes.

The implementation can be found in the
[model-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-backend) repository.

## 💾 Instill Artifact (Coming Soon)

**💾 Instill Artifact** orchestrates unstructured data to transform documents
(e.g., HTML, PDF, CSV, PPTX, DOC), images (e.g., JPG, PNG, TIFF), audio (e.g.,
WAV, MP3 ) and video (e.g., MP4, MOV) into a unified AI-ready format. It ensures
your data is clean, curated, and ready for extracting insights and building your
Knowledge Base.

The implementation is in the
[artifact-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/artifact-backend) repository.

## ⚙️ Instill Component

In **💧 Instill VDP**, a component serves as a basic unit for constructing a pipeline.
The platform provides a diverse range of components, each designed for unique
roles. These components enable pipelines to execute ETL (Extract, Transform,
Load) operations on unstructured data. The available component types are:

- [Generic](/docs/component/generic)
- [AI](/docs/component/ai)
- [Data](/docs/component/data)
- [Application](/docs/component/application)
- [Operator](/docs/component/operator)

The integration framework, written in Go, is housed in the
[component](https://github.com/instill-ai/component) repository.

## 📺 Instill Console

The console of **🔮 Instill Core** is a web-based user interface designed to
facilitate easy interaction with Instill Core. It features a no-code,
drag-and-drop pipeline builder, enabling even non-technical users to easily
construct flexible VDP pipelines by merely dragging and dropping components. The
emphasis is on simplicity and user-friendliness, aiming to offer a cohesive and
intuitive user experience.

The console's maintenance is handled in the
[console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console) repository.

## ⌨️ Instill CLI (Coming Soon)

The command-line interface tool provides a direct and efficient way to interact
with **🔮 Instill Core**. It is designed for developers who prefer working in a
terminal environment or need to automate tasks. The CLI allows users to manage
and control VDP pipelines, components, and other resources without the need for
a graphical interface. It is a powerful tool for scripting and automation,
enabling developers to integrate **🔮 Instill Core** into their existing
development workflows.

The implementation is in the [cli](https://github.com/instill-ai/cli)
repository.

## 📦 Instill SDK

The project provides a set of libraries designed to facilitate the integration
of **🔮 Instill Core** into other applications. It provides a programmatic
interface to interact with the core services, allowing developers to build and
manage VDP pipelines, components, and other resources directly from their code.

Currently, the SDK is available in two languages:

- **Python SDK**: Ideal for data scientists and AI researchers, the Python SDK
  allows for seamless integration with popular data science tools and libraries.
  It is maintained in the [python-sdk](https://github.com/instill-ai/python-sdk)
  repository.

- **TypeScript SDK**: Designed for web and Node.js developers, the TypeScript
  SDK provides type safety and autocompletion, enhancing developer productivity.
  It is maintained in the
  [typescript-sdk](https://github.com/instill-ai/typescript-sdk) repository.

## API-first

**🔮 Instill Core** adopts an **API-first** design principle, enabling seamless
integration with modern data stacks at any scale.

The API foundation relies on [Protocol Buffers version 3
(proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as the Interface
Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the
payload messages. The same interface definitions are used for both REST (via
[gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)) and RPC,
allowing access to the API over different protocols:

- JSON over HTTP
- Protocol Buffers over gRPC

The interface definitions are maintained in
[protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs) with auto-generated Go
codes in [protogen-go](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-go) and Python
code in [protogen-python](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-python). The
official protobuf documentation can be found in our [Buf Scheme Registry
(BSR)](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Release stage

subprojects and components developed and maintained in **🔮 Instill Core** use
release stage defined as below to indicate their readiness:

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha**               | An alpha component indicates that it is under development, and Instill AI is actively collecting early feedback and issues reported by early adopters. Alpha components are not recommended for production use.                                                              |
| **Beta**                | A beta component is considered stable and reliable, with no further backwards incompatible changes expected. However, it may not have been tested by a large user base. Beta releases are intended to identify and fix any remaining issues before moving to the next stage. |
| **Generally Available** | A generally available component has undergone thorough testing and is ready for use in production environments. Its documentation is considered sufficient to support widespread adoption.                                                                                   |
