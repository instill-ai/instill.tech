A **Model** component is an algorithm run on unstructured data to solve a certain [AI task](ai-task).

VDP uses Triton Inference server for model serving. It supports multiple deep learning frameworks including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai).
Besides, the [Python Backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend) enables Triton to support any model written in Python.
To make your models VDP-ready, please refer to [Prepare Models](/docs/prepare-models/overview).

## Definition

VDP uses [ModelDefinition](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/model/v1alpha/model_definition.proto#L30-L76) to define how to configure and import a model from a supported model source.
Please check out [Import Models](/docs/import-models/overview) to learn more.

Instill AI develops and maintains model sources (`ModelDefinition`). We use [release stage](overview#release-stage) to indicate a model source's readiness.

## Model

A **Model**, the core component of a VDP data pipeline, is a piece of ML algorithm specific to processs unstructured data for a certain AI task.

A VDP pipeline can have multiple models running in parallel. The examples below showcase pipeline recipes that incorporate single or multiple models.

<CH.Code>

```json single-model-pipeline
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "source",
      "resource_name": "source-connectors/source-http"
    },
    {
      "id": "model",
      "resource_name": "models/stable-diffusion"
    },
    {
      "id": "destination",
      "resource_name": "destination-connectors/postgres-db"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json multi-model-pipeline
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "source",
      "resource_name": "source-connectors/source-http"
    },
    {
      "id": "model1",
      "resource_name": "models/yolov4"
    },
    {
      "id": "model2",
      "resource_name": "models/yolov7"
    },
    {
      "id": "destination",
      "resource_name": "destination-connectors/destination-http"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CH.Code>

## Model importing and deployment

_VDP provides automatic model inference server._ After importing a model from a supported model source (e.g., GitHub and Hugging Face), and deploying it online, VDP dynamically generate dedicated API endpoints for _model testing and debugging_.
You can then build end-to-end data pipelines using the models to run ETL operations.
Please refer to [Import Models](/docs/import-models/overview) to learn about model versioning with supported model sources.

## State

The state of a model can be `UNSPECIFIED`, `OFFLINE`, `ONLINE` or `ERROR`.

When a model is initially created, the states is by default `OFFLINE`.

A model can be switched to `OFFLINE` state by invoking the `model-backend` endpoint `/undeploy` only when its original state is `ONLINE`.

A model can be switch to `ONLINE` state by invoking the `model-backend` endpoint `/deploy` only when its original state is `OFFLINE`.
Model deployment operation can take time depending on factors like Internet connection and model size.
Before a model is deployed online, the state will be `UNSPECIFIED`.

If the state of a model ends up with `ERROR`, it is undeployable on VDP. Please refer to [Prepare Models](/docs/prepare-models/overview) to make your model VDP-ready.

## Inference

An **inference** is a prediction to a question or task. In the concept of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the term inference is often compared with training.
To put it simple, inference is where capabilities learnt during training are put to analyze data to "infer" a result. Inference can be found and are applied everywhere across industries from photo tagging to autonomous driving.

After deploying a model, you can send multiple images of popular formats (PNG and JPEG) in one request to the generated model API endpoint.
Check the examples below. The API accepts batched images

- sent by remote URL and Base64 or
- uploaded by multipart.

<CH.Code>

```shellscript cURL(url)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/models/{id}/test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/dog.jpg"
    },
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/horse.jpg"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(base64)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/models/{id}/test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZ...iiigD/2Q=="
    },
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4QBLRXh...UR5+f/2Q=="
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(multipart)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/models/{id}/test-multipart \
--form 'file=@"dog.jpg"' \
--form 'file=@"horse.jpg"'
```

</CH.Code>

in which `{id}` corresponds to the ID of a model.
