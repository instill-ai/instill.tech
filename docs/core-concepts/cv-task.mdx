---

Computer Vision (CV) Tasks, a.k.a Vision Tasks, focus on analysing and understanding the content of visual data in the same way as human visual system does. The goal is to make a computer/device provide description for the data as complete and accurate as possible.
Some classic CV Tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation and keypoint detection. These primitive tasks are the foundation for building many real-world industrial vision applications.

Intrigued? Refer to [Prepare Models](/docs/prepare-models/overview) to learn about how to prepare your models for CV Tasks supported by VDP.

## Standardise CV Tasks

In a data pipeline, model is the core component designed to solve a specific CV Task. By standardising the data format of model outputs into CV Tasks,

- model in a pipeline is modularized: you can freely switch to use different models in a pipeline as long as the model is designed for the same CV Task;
- VDP produces a stream of data from models with standard format for use in a data integration or ETL pipeline.

At the moment, VDP defines the data interface for popular CV Tasks:

- _Image classification_ - classify images into predefined categories
- _Object detection_ - detect and localise multiple objects in images
- _Keypoint detection_ - detect and localise multiple keypoints of objects in images
- _OCR (Optical Character Recognition)_ - detect and recognise text in images
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

Each CV Task is described in depth in the respective section below.

If you'd like to **ask for a new model definition**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions), or request it in the **#vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).

## How to standardise

### Standardise via Protocol Buffers

Currently, the model output is converted to standard format based on the CV Task outputs maintained in [Protobuf](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/tree/main/vdp/model/v1alpha).

### Standardise via VDP Protocol

The [VDP Protocol](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/protocol/vdp_protocol.yaml) describes the data schema of CV Task output in order to standardise an ETL pipeline for visual data.
The data produced by the model component and passed to destination component of a pipeline is done via serialized JSON messages for inter-process communication.

```yaml

To be more specific, the above protocol defines the CV Task output for one input image in a batch produced by the corresponding model instance.

The protocol is still under development. Stay tuned on how the protocol will evolve.

## Image classification

Image classification task is the CV Task to assign a single pre-defined category label to an entire input image.
Generally, an image classification model takes an image as the input, and outputs a prediction about what category this image belongs to and a confidence score (usually between 0 and 1) representing the likelihood that the prediction is correct.

  alt="Image classification task"
/>

```json
{
  "classification": {
    "category": "golden retriever",
    "score": 0.98
  }
}
```

## Object detection

Object detection task is the CV Task to localise multiple objects of pre-defined categories in an input image.
Generally, an object detection model receives an image as the input, and outputs bounding boxes with category labels and confidence scores on detected objects.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core-concepts/cv-task-detection.svg"
  alt="Object detection task"
/>

```json
{
  "detection": {
    "objects": [
      {
        "category": "dog",
        "score": 0.97,
        "bounding_box": {
          "top": 102,
          "left": 324,
          "width": 208,
          "height": 405
        }
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

## Keypoint detection

Keypoint detection task is the CV Task to localise multiple objects by identifying their pre-defined keypoints, for example, identifying the keypoints of human body: nose, eyes, ears, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles.
Normally, a keypoint detection task takes an image as the input, and outputs the coordinates and visibility of keypoints with confidence scores on detected objects.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core-concepts/cv-task-keypoint.svg"
  alt="Keypoint detection task"
/>

```json
{
  "keypoint": {
    "objects": [
      {
        "keypoints": [
          {
            "v": 0.53722847,
            "x": 542.82764,
            "y": 86.63817
          },
          {
            "v": 0.634061,
            "x": 553.0073,
            "y": 79.440636
          },
          ...
        ],
        "score": 0.94
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

OCR task is the CV Task to localise and recognise text in an input image.
The task can be done in two steps by multiple models:
a text detection model to detect bounding boxes containing text and
a text recognition model to process typed or handwritten text within each bounding box into machine readable text.
Alternatively, there are deep learning models that can accomplish the task in one single step.

{
  "ocr": {
    "objects": [
      {
        "text": "ENDS",
        "score": 0.99,
        "bounding_box": {
          "top": 298,
          "left": 279,
          "width": 134,
          "height": 59
        }
      },
      {
        "text": "PAVEMENT",
        "score": 0.99,
        "bounding_box": {
          "top": 228,
          "left": 216,
          "width": 255,
          "height": 65
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Instance Segmentation
Instance segmentation is a special form of image segmentation that detect and delineate each distinct object of interest appearing in an image.
It finds large-scale applicability in real-world scenarios like self-driving cars, medical imagining, aerial crop monitoring, and more.

## What if my task is not standardised by by VDP yet?

VDP is very flexible and allows you to import models even if your task is not standardised yet or the output of the model can't be converted to the format of supported CV Tasks.
The model will be classified as an `Unspecified` CV Task. Send an image to the model as the input,
VDP will

- check the `config.pbtxt` [model configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md) file to extract the output names, datatypes and shapes of the model outputs,
- and wrap these information along with the raw model output in a _standard_ format.
