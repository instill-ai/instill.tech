A **Pipeline** component is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.

It is defined by a `recipe` which is essentially a JSON object:

```json
{
  "source": <source-connector-resource-name>,
  "model_instances": [
    <model-instance-resource-name>,
    ...
  ],
  "destination": <destination-connector-resource-name>
}
```

A `recipe` describes a pipeline resource consisting of:

- `source` - where the pipeline starts to ingest unstructured data to be processed
- `model_instances` - a number of deployed AI models to process the ingested unstructured data in parallel to generate structured outputs
- `destination` - where to send the structured outputs

Depending on the use case, the user can create a pipeline in `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, or `PULL` mode. The pipeline mode is determined by the combination of selected source and destination. Continue to read for more details.

## Mode

### `SYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously. The result is sent back to the user right after the data is processed by **Model**. This mode is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern.
The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

To create a `SYNC` pipeline, both source and destination needs to be configured with the same protocol type. VDP supports HTTP and gRPC for a `SYNC` pipeline.

For example, this `recipe` defines a gRPC `SYNC` pipeline for real-time YOLOv7 inference:

```json
{
  "source": "source-connectors/source-grpc",
  "model_instances": ["models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu"],
  "destination": "destination-connectors/destination-grpc"
}
```

### `ASYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs asynchronous workload. The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response.
Once the data has been processed by **Model**, the result is sent to the data destination. This mode is for use cases that do not require inference results immediately.

  alt="ASYNC pipeline mode"
/>

To create an `ASYNC` pipeline, the source can be either HTTP or gRPC, and the destination can be any Airbyte destination connectors.

For example, this `recipe` defines an`ASYNC` pipeline to detect images by YOLOv7 via HTTP request and write the structured detection output into a PostgreSQL database:

```json
{
  "source": "source-connectors/source-http",
  "model_instances": ["models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu"],
  "destination": "destination-connectors/postgres"
}
```

### `PULL` mode (coming soon!)

A pipeline in the `PULL` mode performs scheduled workload to regularly pull data from the **Source** to send to **Model** for inference and write to destination in the end.

  alt="Pipeline PULL mode"

## State

When a pipeline is initially created, the pipeline state is determined by the pipeline's sub-components with the precedence:

- `ERROR` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their `ERROR` state
- `UNSPECIFIED` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their `UNSPECIFIED` state
- `INACTIVE` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their negative state
- `ACTIVE` if **ALL** of its sub-components are in their positive state

A pipeline can be switched to `INACTIVE` state by invoking the `pipeline-backend` endpoint `/deactivate` only when its original state is `ACTIVE`.

A pipeline can be switched to `ACTIVE` state by invoking the `pipeline-backend` endpoint `/activate` only when its original state is `INACTIVE`.
