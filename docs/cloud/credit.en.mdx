The purpose of **Instill Credit** is easing the adoption of **☁️ Instill Cloud**,
minimizing the time required to build and set up a pipeline. After setting up
your account, you'll get **10,000 monthly credits for free**, which can be spent
on the following actions:

- Run your own pipelines, or any public pipeline available on **Instill Hub**.
- Execute pre-configured **AI** components without needing to create accounts or
  API keys on 3rd party services.

We offer [different subscription plans](https://www.instill.tech/pricing) for
users that need more monthly credits to fulfil their pipeline run and API
consumption needs.

## Pipeline Run

Each pipeline run will consume **1 credit per component** within the
pipeline.

This excludes the **trigger** and **response** components which don't consume
any credit, as they are the pipeline's input and output interfaces.

## AI Component

Additionally, Instill AI facilitates out-of-the-box configuration for certain AI
components. When such components are created, if the selected task and model are
supported, the default configuration will contain the credentials to start using
the component.

If you want to override the default configuration and bring your own key, you
can update the **Connection** configuration in your component. Connection fields
only take references to secrets in order to minimize the risk of leaking
credentials when sharing your pipelines. Therefore, you'll need to create a
secret with your API key in your account settings page.

To go back to using the default credentials on your component, you can reference
the `${secrets.INSTILL_SECRET}` in the component configuration. You may use this
reference as well if you want to modify an existing pipeline (e.g. one you
cloned from **Instill Hub**) and use the default credentials on any supported
component.

The following section details the supported AI tasks & models and their **Instill
Credit** cost per unit.

[Newsletter](/newsletter/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link) to keep up
to date with the latest tasks, models and vendors that are supported by
**Instill Credit**.

We also plan to leverage **Instill Credit** to ease data storage and model
hosting, stay tuned!

## Organization Credit

Team plans also include monthly **Instill Credit** for organization, allowing
their users to run pipelines owned by an organization they belong to, without
their own **Instill Credit** being affected. Instead, the organization's credit
will be consumed.

Non-members can still run public pipelines from an organization, but their
personal **Instill Credit** will be consumed during the operation.

## How can I get more credit?

The amount of monthly **Instill Credit** of a user or organization depends on their
[subscription plan](https://www.instill.tech/pricing).

Additionally, subscribers can purchase extra credit in case the monthly amount
doesn't cover their **Instill Credit** needs. In contrast to monthly credit, 
purchase credit won't expire at the end of the billing cycle. For that reason,
purchased credit will only be consumed only when the subscription credit has
been exhausted.

Our roadmap includes more features to cover more complex **Instill Credit** use
cases, such as **Credit Auto-billing**, where credit is topped up before it is
totally exhausted, keeping production environments safe from any potential
downtime.
