Docker Compose is the a straightforward way to set up Instill Core in local machines or remote instances.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Instructions on this page have been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04.
  Nevertheless, we strongly recommend using our auto-deployment tool, [Instill
  CLI](cli), for the deployment process.
</InfoBlock>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - Instill Core works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - Instill Core uses Docker Compose to run all services at local. See the official [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
  and the [Docker Resource Requirements for Instill Core](../deployment#docker-resource-requirements).

## Setup

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="WARNING">
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the
  next release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version,
  use the [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/base/releases) instead.
</InfoBlock>

On your workstation, run:

```shellscript
git clone -b v0.9.0-beta https://github.com/instill-ai/core.git && cd core
make all
```

Running this command will launch both Instill VDP and Instill Model simultaneously.

Here's a handy tip: You can launch individual Instill projects by specifying the project name using the `PROJECT` parameter.
If you're interested in creating AI workflows without the complexities of model serving,
use the following command to launch Instill VDP:

```shellscript core
# Launch Instill VDP only
make all PROJECT=vdp
```

Alternatively, if your primary focus is on building AI models, you can launch Instill Model with the following command:

```shellscript
# Launch Instill Model only
make all PROJECT=model
```

For launching the foundational services, you can use the following command:

```shellscript
# Launch the foundation services
make all PROJECT=core
```

These commands provide you with the flexibility to deploy the specific components you need for your AI projects.
Feel free to make your choice, and once all services are up and running,the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Proceed by following the [authorisation guide](../../quickstart#Authorisation).

## Shutdown

To shutdown and clean up all Instill Core resources, run

```shellscript
make down
```
