The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Data Connector allows users to upload data to Google's Cloud Storage.

## Configuration

Latest configuration is maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector/blob/main/pkg/googlecloudstorage/config/definitions.json)

There are two things needed to configure a GCS connector: Bucket name and JSON Key (for auth).
To get these details, visit https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser and navigate to your bucket.

### No-code Setup

To create a GCS data connector effortlessly, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Data** page and click **Set up new data connector**
2. Click the **Data connector type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **Google Cloud Storage**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Optionally, give a short description in the **Description** field

Now go to the **Data** page, the corresponding GCS data connector should be connected.

### Low-code Setup

For advanced users who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a GCS data connector using the following cURL commands:

1. Create a GCS data connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl  --location http://localhost:8080/vdp/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/connectors
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Your-API-Token>' \
      --data '{
        "id": "gcs-connector",
        "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/data-gcs",
        "description": "GCS connector",
        "configuration": {
          "json_key": "<JSON key file contents here>"
          "bucket_name": "<bucket name>"
        }
      }'
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Supported Tasks

The GCS connector supports these tasks: **Upload**.

1. **Upload** - use this to upload the contents to the given bucket. The input should look something like -

```json
{
  "object_name": "<name of the object/file>",
  "data": "<data to be saved>"
}
```
