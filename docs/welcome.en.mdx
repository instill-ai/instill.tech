[Instill AI](https://www.instill.tech) is on a mission to make AI highly
accessible to everyone. We've been hard at work developing tools that simplify
the process of unlocking value from unstructured data across all layers of the
modern data stack. This means that organizations of all sizes can benefit from
our endeavours. For a deeper dive into our vision, check out our blog post on
[Why Instill AI exists](https://www.instill.tech/blog/why-instill-ai-exists).

## What are we building?

### 🔮 Instill Core

Explore **🔮 [Instill Core](/docs/core/introduction)**, a full-stack AI
infrastructure tool for data, model and pipeline orchestration, designed to
streamline every aspect of building versatile AI-first applications. Accessing
**🔮 Instill Core** is straightforward, whether you opt for **☁️ Instill Cloud**
or self-hosting via the
[instill-core](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core) repository. Please
consult the
[documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/latest/core/deployment/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=org_readme)
for more details.

**💧 Instill VDP**, also known as **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, serves as a
powerful pipeline orchestration tool tailored to address unstructured data ETL
challenges.

**⚗️ Instill Model** is an advanced MLOps/LLMOps platform focused on seamlessly
orchestrating model serving, fine-tuning, and monitoring for persistent
performance. It provides robust model orchestration capabilities, enabling
efficient management and deployment of machine learning models for unstructured
data ETL.

**💾 Instill Artifact** (coming soon) orchestrates unstructured data to
transform documents (e.g., HTML, PDF, CSV, PPTX, DOC), images (e.g., JPG, PNG,
TIFF), audio (e.g., WAV, MP3 ) and video (e.g., MP4, MOV) into a unified
AI-ready format. It ensures your data is clean, curated, and ready for
extracting insights and building your Knowledge Base.

**⚙️ Instill Component** is a fundamental building block for constructing
pipelines, enhancing **💧 Instill VDP** and unlocking limitless possibilities.

### ☁️ Instill Cloud

Not quite into self-hosting? We've got you covered with **☁️ [Instill
Cloud](https://instill.tech/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link)**. It's a
fully managed public cloud service, providing you with access to all the
features of **🔮 Instill Core** without the burden of infrastructure management. All
you need to do is to one-click sign up to start building your AI-first
applications.
