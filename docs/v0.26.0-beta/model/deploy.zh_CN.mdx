Upon successful model import, the state of a model can be `UNSPECIFIED`, `OFFLINE`, `ONLINE` or `ERROR`.

- When a model is initially created, the states is by default `OFFLINE`.
- A model can be switched to `OFFLINE` state by invoking the `model-backend` endpoint `/undeploy` only when its original state is `ONLINE`.
- A model can be switch to `ONLINE` state by invoking the `model-backend` endpoint `/deploy` only when its original state is `OFFLINE`. Model deployment operation can take time depending on factors like Internet connection and model size. Before a model is deployed online, the state will be `UNSPECIFIED`.
- If the state of a model ends up with `ERROR`, it is undeployable on Instill Model. Please refer to [Prepare Models](prepare) to make your model Instill Model ready.

```shellscript deploy
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>/deploy
```

```shellscript undeploy
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>/undeploy
```

in which `<user-id>` and `<model-id>` corresponds to the namespace and ID of a model.
