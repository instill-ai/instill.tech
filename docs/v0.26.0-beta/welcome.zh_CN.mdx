## Instill Core

Explore 🔮 [**Instill Core**](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core), the open-source orchestrator comprising a collection of source-available projects designed to streamline every aspect of building versatile AI features with unstructured data.

### Instill VDP

💧 **Instill VDP**, also known as **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, serves as a powerful data orchestrator tailored to address unstructured data ETL challenges.

- Simplify the journey of processing unstructured data from diverse sources, including AI applications, cloud/on-prem storage, and IoT devices. Utilize AI models and embed business logic to transform raw data into meaningful insights and actionable formats. Efficiently load processed data to warehouses, applications, or other destinations.
- Build flexible, durable pipelines with features like failover, automatic retries, rate limiting, and batching to handle high-volume data straight out of the box.
