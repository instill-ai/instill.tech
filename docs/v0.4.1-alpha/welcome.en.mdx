## Instill Core

🔮 [**Instill Core**](https://github.com/instill-ai/core) is the foundation for self-hosting our open-source unstructured data infrastructure stack.
It houses essential services like user management servers, databases, and third-party observability tools.
Instill Core also provides deployment codes to facilitate the seamless launch of both **Instill VDP** and **Instill Model**.

### Instill VDP

💧 [**Instill VDP**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp), or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, is no-code/low-code pipeline builder that allows you to build, test, release and share AI workflows for unstructured data.
It empowers you to rapidly develop versatile AI capabilities with exceptional speed.

If your goal is to develop versatile AI features using Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI, Vision, or Audio models, Instill VDP empowers you to:

- Effortlessly **connect** to your unstructured data
- **Build** pipelines to enable diverse AI functionalities in your applications
- Visually **test** pipelines with a single click, viewing output at each stage
- Easily **share** your pipelines to showcase your work
