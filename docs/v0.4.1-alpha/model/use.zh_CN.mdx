<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">
  An **inference** is a prediction to a question or task. In the concept of
  Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the term inference is
  often compared with training. To put it simple, inference is where
  capabilities learnt during training are put to analyze data to "infer" a
  result. Inference can be found and are applied everywhere across industries
  from photo tagging to autonomous driving.

_Instill Model provides an automated model inference server._
After importing a model from a supported source, such as GitHub or Hugging Face, and deploying it online,
it dynamically generates dedicated API endpoints for model inference.

```shellscript
/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>
```

```shellscript
/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>
```

You can build VDP pipelines for your AI workflows using the [Instill Model AI Connector](../vdp/connectors/instill-model).

After deploying a model, you can send multiple images of popular formats (PNG and JPEG) in one request to the generated model API endpoint.
Check the examples below. The API accepts batched images

- Sent by remote URL and Base64 or
- Uploaded by multipart.

```shellscript cURL(url)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>/test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/dog.jpg"
    },
    {
      "image_url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/horse.jpg"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(base64)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>/test -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4AAQSkZ...iiigD/2Q=="
    },
    {
      "image_base64": "/9j/4QBLRXh...UR5+f/2Q=="
    }
  ]
}'
```

```shellscript cURL(multipart)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/models/<model-id>/test-multipart \
--form 'file=@"dog.jpg"' \
--form 'file=@"horse.jpg"'
```

in which `<user-id>` and `<model-id>` corresponds to the namespace and ID of a model.
