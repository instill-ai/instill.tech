Docker Compose is the a straightforward way to set up Instill Core in local machines or remote instances.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Instructions on this page have been tested on macOS and Ubuntu 22.04.
  Nevertheless, we strongly recommend using our auto-deployment tool, [Instill
  CLI](cli), for the deployment process.
</InfoBlock>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - Instill Core works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - Instill Core uses Docker Compose to run all services at local. See the official [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

## Setup

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="WARNING">
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the
  next release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version,
  use the [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/base/releases) instead.
</InfoBlock>

On your workstation, run:

```shellscript
git clone -b v0.4.1-alpha https://github.com/instill-ai/core.git && cd core
make all
```

Running this command will launch both Instill VDP and Instill Model simultaneously.

If you're interested in building AI applications without the hassle of model serving, visit the [vdp](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) repository and follow the instructions to launch Instill VDP.
On the other hand, if your focus is solely on model serving, head over to the [model](https://github.com/instill-ai/model) repository to launch Instill Model.

<CH.Code>
```shellscript Launch-VDP
git clone -b v0.16.0-alpha https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
make all
```

```shellscript Launch-Model
git clone -b v0.2.2-alpha https://github.com/instill-ai/model.git && cd model
make all
```

</CH.Code>

Feel free to make your choice, and once all services are up and running,the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Proceed by following the [authorisation guide](../authorisation).

## Shutdown

To shutdown and clean up all Instill Core resources, run

```shellscript
make down
```
