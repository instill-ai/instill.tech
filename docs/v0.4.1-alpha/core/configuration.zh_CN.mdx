<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  [**Core**](https://github.com/instill-ai/core) runs essential services like a
  user management server, databases, and third-party observability tools
  necessary for launching VDP.
</InfoBlock>

Instill Core automatically load a [`.env`](https://github.com/instill-ai/core/blob/main/.env) file that contains key/value pairs defining required environment variables.
You can customize the file based on your configuration.

Besides, they use [Koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf) library for configuration. It supports loading configuration from multiple sources and makes it available to the service.
To override the default configuration file, you can set the corresponding environment variable in the compose file in [core](https://github.com/instill-ai/core/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).
All configuration environment variables for each service are prefixed with `CFG_`.

## Configuring Core Services

Read the default configuration files for a full overview of all supported configuration options of each service:

- [`mgmt-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/mgmt-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml)(`localhost:8084`): a service to handle user management, token management, and metrics
- [`console`](https://github.com/instill-ai/console/blob/main/.env)(`localhost:3000`): a Web-based UI app to provide a unified, clean, and intuitive user experience of Instill VDP and Model

### Configuring Service Version

Set the environment variable for a specific service to determine which version to use in Core.

```shellscript .env
# Set the version of individual Core service
API_GATEWAY_VERSION=<api-gateway-version>
MGMT_BACKEND_VERSION=<mgmt-backend-version>
CONSOLE_VERSION=<console-version>

# Set the version of 3rd party tools
REDIS_VERSION=<redis-version>
POSTGRESQL_VERSION=<postgresql-version>
TEMPORAL_VERSION=<temporal-version>
TEMPORAL_UI_VERSION=<temporal-ui-version>
ELASTICSEARCH_VERSION=<elasticsearch-version>
ETCD_VERSION=<etcd-version>
```

The combination of default versions in `.env` file is fully tested for compatibility.
Unless you are debugging and testing, updating the default versions in the `.env` file is discouraged.

### Configuring the Console

To access Core via Console, set the hosts by overriding the environment variables:

```shellscript .env
CONSOLE_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_HOST=<hostname-to-access-core>
```

By default they are set to `localhost`.

### Configuring the Observability Stack

Observability is critical for distributed microservice architecture.
Through [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), we can generate, collect and export metrics, logs and traces to help analyse the performance and behaviour of VDP services.

The observability stack is disabled by default. You can enable the stack setting `OBSERVE_ENABLED=true` in the [`.env`](https://github.com/instill-ai/core/blob/main/.env) file.
The following telemetry tools are supported now:

- [**Jaeger**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) (`localhost:16686`): OpenTelemetry allows us to export spans to Jaeger. Use Jaeger when you want to debug the complete flow of a request through the VDP services.
- [**InfluxDB**](https://www.influxdata.com/) (`localhost: 8086`, username:`admin`, password:`password`): detailed metrics are sent to InfluxDB for monitoring, and are imported into the Grafana dashboard
- [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) (`localhost:3002`, username:`admin`, password:`admin`): the Grafana dashboard visualises the metrics to monitor the performance and anomalies of VDP services
- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) (`localhost:9090`): VDP exports metrics like `vdp_pipeline_sync_trigger_counter_total` (total number of triggers from SYNC pipelines) and `vdp_pipeline_async_trigger_counter_total` (total number of triggers from ASYNC pipelines) to Prometheus.

Set the environment variable for a specific telemetry tool to determine which version to use in Core.

```shellscript .env
# Set the version of the observability stack
INFLUXDB_VERSION=<influxdb-version>
OTEL_COLLECTOR_VERSION=<otel-collector-version>
JAEGER_VERSION=<jaeger-version>
PROMETHEUS_VERSION=<prometheus-version>
GRAFANA_VERSION=<grafana-version>
```

## Configuring VDP Services

Read the default configuration files for a full overview of all supported configuration options of each service:

- [`pipeline-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml)(`localhost:8081`): a service to build and manage unstructured data pipelines
- [`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend/blob/main/config/config.yaml)(`localhost:8082`): a service to create and manage connectors for composing data pipelines
- [`controller-vdp`](https://github.com/instill-ai/controller-vdp/blob/main/config/config.yaml): a non-public service to monitor the states of pipeline and connector resources

### Configuring VDP Service Version

Set the environment variable for a specific service to determine which version to use in VDP.

```shellscript .env
# Set the version of individual VDP service
INSTILL_CORE_VERSION=<core-version>
API_GATEWAY_VDP_VERSION=<api-gateway-vdp-version>
PIPELINE_BACKEND_VERSION=<pipeline-backend-version>
CONNECTOR_BACKEND_VERSION=<connector-backend-version>
CONTROLLER_VDP_VERSION=<controller-version>
```

The combination of default versions in `.env` file is fully tested for compatibility.
Unless you are debugging and testing, updating the default versions in the `.env` file is discouraged.

## Anonymised Usage Collection

To help us better understand how VDP is used and can be improved, VDP collects and reports _anonymised_ usage statistics.

### What Data is Collected

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  We value your privacy. So, we went for the anonymous data and selected a set
  of details to share from your VDP instance that would give us insights about
  how to improve VDP without being invasive.
</InfoBlock>

When a new VDP is running, the usage client in services including `pipeline-backend`, `connector-backend`, and `mgmt-backend` in VDP will ask for a new session, respectively.
Our usage server returns a token used for future reporting.
For each session, we collect [`Session`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L15-L66) data including some basic information about the service and the system details the service is running on:

- name of the service to collect data from, e.g., `SERVICE_CONNECTOR` for `connector-backend`
- edition of the service to identify the deployment, e.g., `local-ce` for local community edition deployment
- version of the service, e.g., `0.5.0-alpha`
- architecture of the system the service is running on, e.g., `amd64`
- operating system the service is running on, e.g., `Linux`
- uptime in seconds to identify the rough life span of the service

Each session is assigned a random UUID for tracking and identification.
Then, each session will collect and send its own [`SessionReport`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L153-L175) data every 10 minutes:

- [`MgmtUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L68-L72) reports data for `mgmt-backend` session
  - information of the [onboarded User](/docs/vdp/getting-started#start-building-with-vdp)
- [`ConnectorUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L74-L103) reports data for `connector-backend` session of the onboarded User
  - UUID of the onboarded User
  - number of _connected_ or _disconnected_ Sources
  - number of _connected_ or _disconnected_ Destinations
  - an array of `SourceConnectorDefinition` of the Sources
  - an array of `DestinationConnectorDefinition` of the Destinations
- [`PipelineUsageData`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto#L131-L153) reports data for `pipeline-backend` session of the onboarded User
  - UUID of the onboarded User
  - number of _active_ and _inactive_ Pipelines
  - number of `SYNC` and `ASYNC` Pipelines
  - number of images processed by the Pipelines

You can check the full usage data structs in [protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/usage/v1alpha/usage.proto).
These data do not allow us to track Personal Data but enable us to measure session counts and usage statistics.

### Implementation

The anonymous usage report client library is in [`usage-client`](https://github.com/instill-ai/usage-client).
To limit risk exposure, we keep the usage server implementation private for now.
In summary, the Session data and SessionReport sent from each session get updated in the usage server.

Additionally, The frontend Console sends event data to [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com).

### Opting out

VDP usage collection helps the entire community. We'd appreciate it if you can leave it on.
However, if you want to opt out, you can disable it by overriding the `.env` file in Core:

```shellscript .env
USAGE_ENABLED=false
```

This will disable the VDP usage collection for the entire project.

### Acknowledgements

Our anonymised usage collection was inspired by KrakenD's [How we built our telemetry service](https://www.krakend.io/blog/building-a-telemetry-service/)
and would love to acknowledge that their design has helped us to bootstrap our usage collection project.
