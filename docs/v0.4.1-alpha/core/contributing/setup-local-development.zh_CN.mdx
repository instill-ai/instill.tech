Instill Core is currently under rapid development.
The system architecture shown below is subject to change but will always follow the general guidance described in [Tech](/docs/faq#tech).

The project is built with the microservice architecture. To develop each service independently,
we assign [profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles) to each service in
the [`docker-compose.latest.yml`](https://github.com/instill-ai/core/blob/main/docker-compose.latest.yml) file in Core.
This allows us to selectively enable services for various purposes, e.g., debugging, development.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Services are associated with profiles through the `profiles` attribute, which
  takes an array of profile names. A service will be started only if one of its
  profile names is activated. A service without `profiles` will always be
  started.
</InfoBlock>

Core assigns seven different profile names:

- `console` - start all the dependent services for [`console`](https://github.com/instill-ai/console)
- `mgmt` - start all the dependent services for [`mgmt-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/mgmt-backend)
- `api-gateway` - start all the dependent services for [`api-gateway`](https://github.com/instill-ai/api-gateway)
- `connector` - start all the dependent services for [`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend)
- `pipeline` - start all the dependent services for [`pipeline-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend)
- `controller-vdp` - start all the dependent services for [`controller-vdp`](https://github.com/instill-ai/controller-vdp)
- `model` - start all the dependent services for [`model`](https://github.com/instill-ai/model)
- `controller-model` - start all the dependent services for [`controller-model`](https://github.com/instill-ai/controller-model)
- `all` - start all services

Use one of the profile name to develop the corresponding service:

```shellscript
# In the core repository folder
make build-latest
make latest PROFILE=<profile-name>
```

The following guideline shows a specific example of how to develop the `pipeline-backend`.

## Start dependent services for `pipeline-backend`

On the local machine, clone the `core` repository in your workspace, move to the repository folder, and launch all dependent services:

```shellscript
# Clone the core repository
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/core.git && cd core

# Use profile `pipeline` to launch all dependent services
# for `pipeline-backend`
make build-latest
make latest PROFILE=pipeline
```

## Run dev `pipeline-backend`

Clone the `pipeline-backend` repository in your workspace and move to the repository folder:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend.git
cd pipeline-backend
```

**Build & run the dev image**

```shellscript
make build
make dev
```

Now, you have the Go project set up in the container, in which you can compile and run the binaries together with the integration test in each container shell.

**Start the `pipeline-backend` server**

```shellscript
docker exec -it pipeline-backend /bin/bash
go run ./cmd/migration
go run ./cmd/main
```

**Start the Temporal worker**

```shellscript
docker exec -it pipeline-backend /bin/bash
go run ./cmd/worker
```

**Run the integration test**

During local development, you can run the integration test to make sure your latest `pipeline-backend` works as intended:

```shellscript
docker exec -it pipeline-backend /bin/bash
make integration-test
```

## Stop the dev container

```shellscript
make stop
```

## To shut down all dependent Core services:

```shellscript
# In the core repository folder
make down
```
