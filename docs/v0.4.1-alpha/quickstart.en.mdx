### Self-hosted Instill Core

If you're configuring Instill Core for the first time, please visit the Console (http://localhost:3000) and use the following initial login details to initiate the password reset process for onboarding:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

This protects Instill Core from being acceesible by anyone when deployed.

Instill Cloud empowers you to build pipelines tailored for processing unstructured data using Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP).
The central concept in VDP is the Pipeline, which automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.
A pipeline comprises different types of Connectors and Operators.

## Setting up your first pipeline

In this guide, we'll walk you through building your first VDP pipeline, focusing on a basic Generative pipeline using the [Stability AI AI Connector](/docs/vdp/ai-connectors/stability-ai), which seamlessly integrates with Stability AI's services.

To begin, head to [Instill Cloud Console](https://console.instill.tech/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=23q2-instill-cloud-launch) and sign up for a free trial using your email address, Google, or GitHub social login.

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. As you haven't set up any pipelines yet, the page will be empty.
To create your first pipeline through the VDP Console, click on **Add new pipeline**. This will redirect you to the no-code pipeline builder.
In the canvas, you can drag and drop connectors and operators to construct your pipeline.

**Step 1: Add a Start Operator**

The Start Operator serves as the starting point of a VDP pipeline.

To set up a Start operator,

1. Click the **Operator** on the left and drag **Start** into the canvas
2. Click **Create**

**Step 2: Set up an AI Connector**

Instill Cloud provides a list of public AI connectors (under **Instill Connectors** section) that are ready to use,
so you don't need to create accounts for third-party AI services.

For this example, click the **AI** and drag a Stability AI AI connector with ID **instill-stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0** into the canvas.

**Step 3: Set up an End Operator**

The End Operator is used at the end of a VDP pipeline to receive the output as a response when triggering the pipeline.

To set up an End operator,

1. Click the **Operator** on the left and drag **End** into the canvas
2. Click **Create**

**Step 4: Construct a pipeline**

We are almost there! The final step is to link the components, and your pipeline will be ready to go:

1. Link the "texts" and "metadata" outputs of **start** component with the corresponding inputs of **instill-stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0** component
2. Link the "images" and "metadata" output of **instill-stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0** component to the corresponding input of **end** component
3. Link the "texts" output of **start** component to the corresponding input of **end** component
4. The pipeline will be assigned a randomly generated unique ID. You can change it on the right panel, e.g., "aigc". Optionally, you can add a description
5. Click **Create** to create the pipeline, and the click **Activate** to activate it

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
You have successfully set up your first VDP pipeline.
The pipeline is now **active** and can be triggered via HTTP or gRPC requests.

For more information on pipeline states, refer to the [documentation](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline#state).

### Triggering the pipeline

Before triggering the pipeline, you need a valid API token.
If you don't have one yet, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Settings** in the top right of the navigation bar
2. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page
3. Click **Create Token** and give it an ID

The API tokens do not expire, so keep them safe.
If a token is compromised, select it and click **Delete**.
Be cautious, as this operation cannot be undone, and apps using the token will stop working.

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process data.
To trigger the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Find the example HTTP request to trigger the pipeline in the right panel of the pipeline page
2. Copy the cURL request in the **Trigger the pipeline** section and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the authorization headers
3. Adjust and ingest your data accordingly in the example request

Here is an example trigger request for the pipeline:

```shellscript cURL(url)
// Please put your data to the appropriate field based on its data type:
//   - "texts": an array containing your text data to be processed
//   - "images": an array containing your image data to be processed
//     - "url": image with URL format
//     - "blob": image in Base64 format
//   - "metadata": a JSON object containing metadata for the data to be processed

curl -X POST https://api-vdp.instill.tech/v1alpha/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_...' -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "texts": [
        "a highly detailed matte painting of team members on a hill watching a rocket launched in the distance with a moon by studio ghibli, makoto shinkai, by artgerm, by greg rutkowski, volumetric lighting, octane render, 4k resolution, trending on artstation, masterpiece"
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024,
        "steps": 50,
        "cfg_scale": 20,
        "seed": 17259,
        "samples": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You should receive the following response:

```shellscript cURL(url)
{
    "outputs": [
        {
            "data_mapping_index": "01H6J8W46F5EZT6TXVYVG15BBP",
            "texts": [
              "a highly detailed matte painting of team members on a hill watching a rocket launched in the distance with a moon by studio ghibli, makoto shinkai, by artgerm, by greg rutkowski, volumetric lighting, octane render, 4k resolution, trending on artstation, masterpiece"
            ],
            "images": [
                {
                  "blob": "iVBORw0..."
                }
            ],
            "structured_data": null,
            "metadata": {
                "pipeline": {
                    "id": "aigc",
                    "owner": "users/41db6f86-97b3-4374-8678-67ae639400f8",
                    "trigger_id": "e72c32cd-a1c5-442c-adf3-53817129ebd9",
                    "uid": "b5b5565d-6f7b-432c-ad2a-1b2878c6624d"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To obtain the generated image, decode the "images" field of the response from Base64 format.

## Using Model on Instill Cloud

We deploy our source available product [Model](https://github.com/instill-ai/model) on Instill Cloud.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Notice">

You may notice that _importing your own models_ is currently disabled in the Model Hub of Instill Cloud.
We are actively working on refining the Model service to offer a more stable user experience.

</InfoBlock>

### Access pre-trained ML models

Deploying and maintaining ML models in a production environment can be challenging.
To simplify this process, we have deployed a list of pre-trained ML models on Instill Cloud.
These models are ready for use and are entirely free during Open Alpha.

To explore the available pre-deployed ML models for different AI tasks, navigate to the **Model Hub** on the Instill Cloud console.
Each model in the Model Hub is designed to handle a specific [AI task](/docs/core-concepts/ai-task).

For detailed information about a specific model, click on its ID and review the Description and Setting sections.
If you want to import the model into VDP, refer to the VDP documentation on the [Instill Model AI connector](/docs/vdp/ai-connectors/instill-model).

Thank you for using Instill Cloud!
