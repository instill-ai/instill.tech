Instill Cloud empowers you to build pipelines tailored for processing unstructured data using Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP).
The central concept in VDP is the Pipeline, which automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.
A pipeline comprises different types of Connectors and Operators.

## Build Your First AI Workflow

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Prerequisites">

To get started with this tutorial, you'll need both an OpenAI account and a Stability AI account. Here's how to set them up:

- Create an OpenAI account by visiting [openai.com](https://openai.com). Access to your API keys can then be managed through OpenAI's Account page.
- Create a Stability AI account by visiting [dreamstudio.ai](https://dreamstudio.ai). Access to your API keys can then be managed through DreamStudio's Account page. All new users are granted 25 free credits upon creating an account.

### Build the Pipeline

In this guide, we'll walk you through creating your first AI pipeline,
specifically focusing on a generative pipeline using the [OpenAI](./vdp/ai-connectors/openai) and [Stability AI](./vdp/ai-connectors/stability-ai) Connectors to generate digital stickers.

**Step1: Add Connector Resources**

Begin by navigating to the **Resources** page on the left sidebar.
Since you haven't set up any pipelines yet, this page will be empty.

To set up an OpenAI connector resource, follow these steps:

1. Click on **+ Add Resource**, add select **OpenAI** on the Modal.
2. Provide a unique ID for the resource. Here we use _openai_. Optionally, you can add a description.
3. Fill in the **API Key**. Follow the OpenAI [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) to find your API key.
4. Optionally, specify which organization is used for the request.
5. Click **Save**.

Next, set up a Stability AI connector resource:

1. Click on **+ Add Resource**, add select **Stability AI** on the Modal.
2. Assign a unique ID for the resource. Here we use _stability-ai_, and you can Optionally add a description.
3. Provide the **API Key**. Follow the Stability AI [documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication) to find your API key.
4. Click **Save**.

Now, head to the Pipelines page on the left sidebar.
To create your first pipeline through the Console, click on **+ Add Pipeline**.
This will redirect you to the no-code pipeline builder.
The pipeline will be assigned a randomly generated unique ID. You can change it on the right, for example, _digital-sticker-maker_.
On the canvas, you can drag and drop connectors and operators to construct your pipeline.

**Step 2: Build the Pipeline in the No-code Pipeline Builder**

The Start Operator serves as the starting point of a VDP pipeline, where you can define the input data for your application.

To set up a Start operator:

1. Locate the **start** operator on canvas
2. Click **Add Field +** and select **Text**. Fill in the **Title** with _Prompt_ and **Key** with _prompt_.
3. Click **Add Field +** and select **Text**, Fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_ and **Key** with _shape_.
4. Click **Save**.

This configuration requires two inputs: a prompt to generate the idea for the sticker and a shape parameter to control the sticker's appearance.

To configure an OpenAI connector:

1. Click **Add Connector +** and choose **openai** from existing resource. This will add a OpenAI connector `ai_0` to the canvas.
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon on the `ai_0` to open configuration right panel.
3. Select _TASK_TEXT_GENERATION_ from the dropdown of the **Task** field.
4. Choose **Model** to choose the model to use, e.g., _gpt-3.5-turbo_.
5. Set **N** to in the _1_ to indicate only one chat completion.
6. Fill **System Message** to set the behavior of the model. Here we set the value to:

```
You are a prompt engineer to generate Stable Diffusion prompts to generate sticker images
```

7. In the **Prompt** field, specify the text prompt to generate an LLM augmented prompt:

```
Augment the prompt with descriptive details for generating sticker images, and add the styles exactly at the end of the prompt "sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut {{start.shape}} sticker with white border".

Prompt: a bear
Output: a brown bear dancing in a forest, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut {{start.shape}} sticker with white border
Prompt: a dog writes code
Output: a dog writes code in front of a laptop and drinks coffee, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut {{start.shape}} sticker with white border
Prompt: {{start.prompt}}
Output:
```

8. Fill **Temperature** with a number between 0 and 2 to control how random the generation is, e.g., _1_.
9. Click **Save**.

The OpenAI connector will automatically link to the Start operator
since we have used `{{start.shape}}` and `{{start.prompt}}` in the OpenAI connector configuration.
The `{{}}` placeholders represent **string values** to be filled during pipeline triggering.

To set up an Stability AI connector:

1. Click **+ Add Resource** and choose **stability-ai** from existing resource. This will add a OpenAI connector `ai_1` to the canvas.
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon on the `ai_1` to open configuration right panel.
3. Select _TASK_TEXT_TO_IMAGE_ from the dropdown of the **Task** field.
4. Adjust **CFG Scale** to control how strictly the diffusion process adheres to the text prompt, e.g., set it to _8_.
5. Choose the **Engine** to use, e.g., _stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0_.
6. In the **Prompts** field, specify the generated text array from the OpenAI connector output `{ai_0.output.texts}`.
7. Set **Samples** to _1_ to indicate generating only one image.
8. Specify a **Seed** with _0_ for a randomization.
9. Fill **Steps** to _30_ to indicate the number of diffusion steps to run.
10. Click **Save**.

You will see that the Stability AI connector is automatically linked to the OpenAI connector
since we have used `{ai_0.output.texts}` in the Stability AI connector configuration.

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="Tip">
  The `{}` placeholders are used to reference values from previous connectors.
  Unlike the `{{}}` placeholders, `{}` retains the type of the referenced value.
</InfoBlock>

The End Operator is used at the end of a VDP pipeline to receive the output as a response when triggering the pipeline.

To set up an End operator:

1. Find the **end** operator on canvas.
2. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _My Original Prompt_, **Key** with _my_original_prompt_ and **Value** with `{start.prompt}`.
3. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_, **Key** with _sticker_shape_ and **Value** with `{start.shape}`.
4. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _LLM Powered Prompt_, **Key** with _llm_powered_prompt_ and **Value** with `{ai_0.output.texts}`.
5. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Digital Sticker_, **Key** with _digital_sticker_ and **Value** with `{ai_0.output.images}`.
6. Click **Save**.

You will see that the End operator is automatically linked to multiple components: `start`, `ai_0` and `ai_1`.

Click **Save** on the top right corner, and your pipeline is ready to be tested.

### Test the Pipeline via No-Code

üéâ Congratulations! Your first VDP pipeline is all set up and ready to go. Now, simply click on the **Test** button located in the top right corner.

You can now put your pipeline to the test using real data. For instance, let's create a sticker featuring a yellow plane in the sky.

```
Prompt: yellow plane on the sky
Shape: round
```

Click **Run**.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core/test-pipeline.png"
  alt="Test the pipeline with real data"
/>

As you can see, the OpenAI ChatGPT model has expanded our initial prompt, turning it into:

```
a yellow plane flying gracefully in a clear blue sky, leaving behind fluffy white clouds, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut round sticker with white border
```

Give it a try!

### Use the Pipeline via Low-Code

To triggering the pipeline, you need a valid API token.
If you don't have one yet, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Settings** on the left sidebar
2. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page
3. Click **Create Token** and give it an ID

The API tokens do not expire, so keep them safe.
If a token is compromised, select it and click **Delete**.
Be cautious, as this operation cannot be undone, and apps using the token will stop working.

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process data.
To trigger the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Click the bottom right icon to display the Pipeline toolkit
2. Copy the cURL request in the **Trigger Snippet** section and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header
3. Adjust and ingest your data accordingly in the example request

Here is an example trigger request for the pipeline:

```shellscript

curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/vdp/v1alpha/users/xiaofei/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data  '{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"prompt": "yellow plane on the sky",
			"shape": "round"
		}
	]
}'

```

You should receive the following response:

```shellscript
{
    "outputs": [
        {
            "digital_sticker": [
                "iVBORw0KGgo...SUVORK5CYII="
