Instill Core or Instill Cloud empowers you to build pipelines tailored for processing unstructured data using Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP).
The central concept in VDP is the Pipeline, which automates a sequence of components to process unstructured data.

## Build Your First AI Workflow

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Third-party vendors">

  This tutorial uses AI components to connect to **OpenAI** and **Stability AI**.

  With your Instill Cloud account, you'll receive **10,000 monthly Instill Credits**, which will allow you to use such components without needing to set up an account in these services.

</InfoBlock>

### Build the Pipeline

In this guide, we'll walk you through creating your first AI pipeline,
specifically focusing on a generative pipeline using the [OpenAI](./component/ai/openai) and [Stability AI](./component/ai/stabilityai) components to generate digital stickers.

#### Create the pipeline

Head to the **Pipelines** page on the navbar.
To create your first pipeline through the Console:

1. Click on **+ Create Pipeline**.
2. Assign a unique ID for the pipeline. Here we use _digital-sticker-maker_, and you can optionally add a description. By default, the owner of the pipeline is your account. But you can also assign it to an organization that you are a member of.
3. Choose the visibility of the pipeline. By default, the pipeline is private, but you can also make it public, so that it can be seen by anyone.
4. Click **Create**.

This will redirect you to the no-code pipeline builder.
On the canvas, you can drag and drop components to construct your pipeline.

A blank canvas contains two components that serve as the pipeline input and output interface:
- **Trigger** is used to set the pipeline parameters when triggering a pipeline.
- **Response** is used to collect the results of a trigger.

To set up the Trigger component:

1. Locate the **trigger** component on the canvas.
2. Click **Add Field +** and select **Short Text**. Fill in the **Title** with _Prompt_. The reference key for this field will be _prompt_. Click **Save**.
3. Click **Add Field +** and select **Short Text**, Fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_. Similarly, the reference key for this field will be _sticker_shape_. Click **Save**.

This configuration requires two inputs: a prompt to generate the idea for the sticker and a shape parameter to control the sticker's appearance.

#### Create the OpenAI component

1. Click **Component +** and choose **OpenAI** from **Components**. This will add a OpenAI component `openai_0` to the canvas.
2. Select **Text Generation** from the dropdown of the **OpenAI Component** field.
3. Choose **Model** to choose the model to use, e.g., _gpt-3.5-turbo_. You can identify the models that support default credentials from the icon next to them, displaying stack of tokens.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Bring Your Own Key">
  You can always use your own API Keys on the components in this tutorial by introducing them in the component's **Connection** configuration.
</InfoBlock>

4. In the **Prompt** field, specify the text prompt to generate an LLM augmented prompt:

```
Augment the prompt with descriptive details for generating sticker images, and add the styles exactly at the end of the prompt "sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${trigger.sticker_shape} sticker with white border".
Only return the output content.

Prompt: a bear
Output: a brown bear dancing in a forest, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${trigger.sticker_shape} sticker with white border
Prompt: a dog writes code
Output: a dog writes code in front of a laptop and drinks coffee, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${trigger.sticker_shape} sticker with white border
Prompt: ${trigger.prompt}
Output:
```

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="Pipeline Component Reference">
  This prompt references the input fields in the Trigger component, providing extra context to OpenAI in order to generate a more robust and complete image prompt.

  When establishing connections between components, referencing a component field is as simple as using `${}`.
  When you enter `${` into an input field, the smart hint feature intelligently filters and presents only the relevant hints that are compatible with the field.
</InfoBlock>


5. Click the **More** link on the `openai_0` component to open configuration right panel.
6. Fill **System Message** to set the behavior of the model. Here we set the value to:

```
You are a prompt engineer to generate Stable Diffusion prompts to generate sticker images.
```

7. Fill **Temperature** with a number between 0 and 2 to control how random the generation is, e.g., _1_.
8. Set **n** to _1_ to indicate only one chat completion.

The OpenAI component will automatically link to the Trigger component
since we have used `${trigger.sticker_shape}` and `${trigger.prompt}` in the OpenAI component configuration.
The `${}` placeholders represent **string values** to be filled during pipeline triggering.

#### Create the Stability AI component

1. Click **Component +** and choose **Stability AI** from **Components**. This will add a Stability AI component `stability_0` to the canvas.
2. Select **Text To Image** from the dropdown of the **Stability AI Component** field.
3. Choose the **Engine** to use, e.g., _stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0_.
4. In the **Prompts** field, specify the generated text array from the OpenAI component output `${openai_0.output.texts}`.
5. Click the **More** link on the `stability_0` component to open configuration right panel.
6. Update the **width** to _1024_ and the **height** to _1024_ to set the resolution of the generated image.
6. Adjust **CFG Scale** to control how strictly the diffusion process adheres to the text prompt, e.g., set it to _8_.
7. Set **Samples** to _1_ to indicate generating only one image.
8. Specify a **Seed** with _0_ for a randomization.
9. Fill **Steps** to _30_ to indicate the number of diffusion steps to run.

You will see that the Stability AI component is automatically linked to the OpenAI component
since we have used `${openai_0.output.texts}` in the Stability AI component configuration.

#### Configure the Response component

The Response Component is used at the end of a VDP pipeline to return the pipeline trigger outputs.

1. Find the **response** component on the canvas.
2. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _My Original Prompt_, the reference key for this field will be _my_original_prompt_, and **Value** with `${trigger.prompt}`. Click **Save**.
3. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_, the reference key for this field will be _sticker_shape_, and **Value** with `${trigger.sticker_shape}`. Click **Save**.
4. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _LLM Powered Prompt_, the reference key for this field will be _llm_powered_prompt_, and **Value** with `${openai_0.output.texts}`. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Digital Sticker_, the reference key for this field will be _digital_sticker_, and **Value** with `${stability_0.output.images}`. Click **Save**.

You will see that the End component is automatically linked to multiple components: `trigger`, `openai_0` and `stability_0`.

Click **Save** on the top right corner, your pipeline is ready to be tested!

### Test the Pipeline via No-Code

🎉 Congratulations! Your first VDP pipeline is all set up and ready to go.

You can now test your pipeline using real data. Let's create, for instance, a sticker featuring a yellow plane in the sky.

```
Prompt: yellow plane on the sky
Shape: round
```

Now, simply click on the **Run** button located in the top right corner.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core/test-pipeline.png"
  alt="Test the pipeline with real data"
/>

Click the Output tab of the `openai_0` component to view the generated output.
As you can see, the OpenAI ChatGPT model has expanded our initial prompt, turning it into:

```
a yellow plane soaring through a clear blue sky, sticker style, flat icon,
vector, die-cut round sticker with white border
```

Give it a try!

### Use the Pipeline via Low-Code

In order to trigger the pipeline, you need a valid API token.
If you don't have one yet, follow these steps:

1. Click on the profile icon on the top right corner of the main page in the console and select **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page.
3. Click **Create Token** and give it an ID.

The API tokens do not expire, so keep them safe.
If a token is compromised, select it and click **Delete**.
Be cautious, as this operation cannot be undone, and apps using the token will stop working.

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process data.
To trigger the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Toolkit** button on the top right corner of the pipeline canvas.
2. Copy the _cURL_ request in the **Trigger Snippet** section and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
3. Adjust and ingest your data accordingly in the example request.

Here is an example trigger request for the pipeline:

```shellscript

curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/vdp/v1beta/users/<user-id>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data  '{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"prompt": "yellow plane on the sky",
			"sticker_shape": "round"
		}
	]
}'

```

Where `<user-id>` represents your username, and `<pipeline-id>` corresponds to the pipeline ID.

You should receive the following response:

```shellscript
{
    "outputs": [
        {
            "digital_sticker": [
                "iVBORw0KGgo...SUVORK5CYII="
            ],
            "llm_powered_prompt": [
                "a bright yellow vintage plane flying through a fluffy white cloud-filled sky, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut round sticker with white border"
            ],
            "prompt": "yellow plane on the sky",
            "sticker_shape": "round"
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "traces": {...}
    }
}
```

To obtain the generated image, decode the `digital_sticker` field of the response from Base64 format.

### Generate Stickers in Batch

Interested in generating multiple stickers at once? You can do this by adjusting the Stability AI component configuration and setting **Samples** to _4_.

Save your changes and test the pipeline again with the following prompt:

```
Prompt: cat reads a book
Shape: round
```
