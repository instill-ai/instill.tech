You can access our products using Instill Core or Instill Cloud.

## What is Instill Core?

Instill Core empowers you to deploy source-available [Base](#what-is-base), [Model](#what-is-model) and [VDP](#what-is-vdp) products, enabling you to build AI pipelines for unstructured data.

## What is Instill Cloud?

☁️ Instill Cloud is a fully-managed public cloud service for Instill Core.
It is the easiest and most reliable way to access VDP and Model. Additionally, it provides:

- Painless setup
- Maintenance-free infrastructure
- Production-ready services
- Start for free, pay as you grow

👉 [Try Instill Cloud today](https://console.instill.tech/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=23q2-instill-cloud-launch) by following the [guideline](/docs/instill-cloud/getting-started).
The service is currently in **Open Alpha** testing phase - with all features **FREE**.

## What is VDP?

[**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) is a source available unstructured data infrastructure tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline:

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- **Transform** it into analysable or meaningful data representations by AI models
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

We've made it easy to get started with VDP either through Instill Cloud or self-hosting Instill Core. Learn more with [how to deploy VDP](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview).

## What is Model?

[**Model**](https://github.com/instill-ai/model), also referred to as **Instill Model** in the documentation, is a ModelOps platform that
allows you to import and serve Machine Learning (ML) models for inference. It is also source vailable. Check out [how to deploy Model](/docs/model/deployment/overview).

## What is Base?

[**Base**](https://github.com/instill-ai/base), also referred to as **Instill Base** in the documentation,
runs essential services like a user management server, databases, and third-party observability tools necessary for launching VDP and Model.
Additionally, it incorporates [Console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console), a user-friendly web-based UI application that enhances the accessibility of VDP and Model.
