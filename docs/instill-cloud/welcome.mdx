## What is VDP?

[**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) is a source available unstructured data infrastructure tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline:

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- **Transform** it into analysable or meaningful data representations by AI models
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

We've made it easy to get started with VDP either through Instill Cloud or self-hosting Instill Core.

## What is Model?

[**Model**](https://github.com/instill-ai/model), also referred to as **Instill Model** in the documentation, is a ModelOps platform that
allows you to import and serve Machine Learning (ML) models for inference. It is also source vailable.

## What is Base?

[**Base**](https://github.com/instill-ai/base), also referred to as **Instill Base** in the documentation,
runs essential services like a user management server, databases, and third-party observability tools necessary for launching VDP and Model.
Additionally, it incorporates [Console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console), a user-friendly web-based UI application that enhances the accessibility of VDP and Model.
