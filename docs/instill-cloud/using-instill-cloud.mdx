## Set up your first pipeline

Instill Cloud enables you to build pipelines specifically for unstructured data via VDP.

First, follow the [Get access to pre-trained ML models](#get-access-to-pre-trained-ml-models) to check the details of each model and find the model you want.
In case the model is not yet supported, consider reporting to our [Discord community](http://go.instill.tech/4ey9lz).

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. Since we have not yet set up any pipeline, this page will be empty.
To create your first pipeline via VDP Console, click **Add new pipeline**.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

**Pipeline** is the most important concept in VDP. Check the [documentation](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline) for more details.

**Step 1: Add an HTTP source**

VDP currently supports two sources, HTTP and gRPC for **SYNC** pipeline. An HTTP source accepts HTTP requests with payloads to be processed by a pipeline.

To set up a **Source Connector**,

1. click the **Pipeline mode** â–¾ drop-down and choose `Sync`,
2. click the **Source type** â–¾ drop-down and choose HTTP, and
3. click **Next**.

**Step 2: Set up a Model**

Click the **Online models** â–¾ drop-down and choose the model you want

**Step 3: Add an HTTP destination**

Since we are building a **SYNC** pipeline, the `HTTP` destination is paired automatically with the `HTTP` source as we set up for the source. Click **Next**.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="paired data connectors">

When creating pipelines under **SYNC** mode, source and destination connectors in VDP must be the same, which means:

- HTTP source â†’ HTTP destination
- gRPC source â†’ gRPC destination

</InfoBlock>

**Step 4: Set up a pipeline**

We are almost there! We have created `Source`, `Model`, and `Destination`. The last step is to give this pipeline an ID, and we are ready to go! Just

1. give your pipeline a unique ID, e,g., **instill-sync**,
2. add a description (optional), and
3. click **Set up**.

ðŸŽ‰ _Ta-da!_ You have your first VDP pipeline setup. You should see it on the **Pipeline** page.
The **green** light indicates the pipeline is Active and can be triggered via sending HTTP requests.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="pipeline states">
  Check out the [docs](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline#state) to understand all the
  pipeline states.
</InfoBlock>

## Trigger the pipeline

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process unstructured data.

Click the newly created pipeline on the **Pipeline** page, you will find further details about this pipeline including
the corresponding HTTP request examples to trigger the pipeline at the bottom of the page.

**Create an API token**

In order to trigger the pipeline, you will need a valid API token.
If you don't yet have a token, Click the **Settings** on the left sidebar, and navigate to the **API tokens** page.
Just click **Create Token** and give it an ID.

The tokens are non-expiry. Please keep them in a safe place.
If your token is ever compromised, choose that token and click **Delete**.
But be careful when you delete an API token. This operation can not be undone.
All your apps using this token will stop working.

**Trigger the pipeline**

Simply copy the cURL request in the Trigger section, and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the authorization headers.
For example, assuming you have created a pipeline for Image Classification, using cURL, you can trigger the pipeline as follows:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api-s.instill-inc.tech/v1alpha/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/triggerSync \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_...' \
...
```

<InfoBlock type="info" title="standardise AI task">
  We have standardised the input and output format of each AI task. Check out
  the supported [AI task](/docs/core-concepts/ai-task).
</InfoBlock>

## Get access to pre-trained ML models

A **Model** component is an algorithm run on unstructured data to solve a certain [AI task](/docs/core-concepts/ai-task).

Deploying and maintaining ML models in a production environment is hard!
It often takes more effort and a lot longer to deploy a model to production than to develop it offline.

Therefore, we have deployed a list of pre-trained ML models on Instill Cloud. They are ready for use and are totally free during Open Alpha.
On the Instill Cloud console, click **Model** to access all the pre-deployed ML models for different AI tasks.
To get the details of a specific model, click on the model ID and see the **Description** and **Setting** sections.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Notice">

You may find that Import models are disabled in Instill Cloud. It is because
we are rapidly refactoring Model service to offer a more stable user
experience.
