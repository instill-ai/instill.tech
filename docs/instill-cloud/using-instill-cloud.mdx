## Use VDP on Instill Cloud

### Set up your first pipeline

Instill Cloud enables you to build pipelines specifically for unstructured data via VDP.
In case the model connector is not yet supported, consider reporting to our [Discord community](http://go.instill.tech/4ey9lz).

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. Since we have not yet set up any pipeline, this page will be empty.
To create your first pipeline via VDP Console, click **Add new pipeline**.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

**Pipeline** is the most important concept in VDP. Check the [documentation](/docs/vdp/core-concepts/pipeline) for more details.

</InfoBlock>

**Step 1: Add an HTTP source**

VDP currently supports two sources, HTTP and gRPC for pipeline. An HTTP source accepts HTTP requests with payloads to be processed by a pipeline.

To set up a **Source Connector**,

1. click the **Pipeline mode** â–¾ drop-down and choose `Sync`,
2. click the **Source type** â–¾ drop-down and choose HTTP, and
3. click **Next**.

**Step 2: Set up a AI Connector**

Click the **AI Connector** â–¾ drop-down and choose the AI connector you want

**Step 3: Set up a pipeline**

We are almost there! We have created `Source`, `Model`, and `Destination`. The last step is to give this pipeline an ID, and we are ready to go! Just

1. give your pipeline a unique ID, e,g., **instill-sync**,
2. add a description (optional), and
3. click **Set up**.

ðŸŽ‰ _Ta-da!_ You have your first VDP pipeline setup. You should see it on the **Pipeline** page.
The **green** light indicates the pipeline is Active and can be triggered via sending HTTP requests.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="pipeline states">
  Check out the [docs](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline#state) to understand all the
  pipeline states.
</InfoBlock>

### Trigger the pipeline

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process unstructured data.

Click the newly created pipeline on the **Pipeline** page, you will find further details about this pipeline including
the corresponding HTTP request examples to trigger the pipeline at the bottom of the page.

**Create an API token**

In order to trigger the pipeline, you will need a valid API token.
If you don't yet have a token, Click the **Settings** on the left sidebar, and navigate to the **API tokens** page.
Just click **Create Token** and give it an ID.

The tokens are non-expiry. Please keep them in a safe place.
If your token is ever compromised, choose that token and click **Delete**.
But be careful when you delete an API token. This operation can not be undone.
All your apps using this token will stop working.

**Trigger the pipeline**

Simply copy the cURL request in the Trigger section, and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the authorization headers.
For example, assuming you have created a pipeline for Image Classification, using cURL, you can trigger the pipeline as follows:

```shellscript cURL(url)
// Please put your data to the appropriate field based on its data type:
//   - "texts": an array containing your text data to be processed
//   - "images": an array containing your image data to be processed
//   - "metadata": a JSON object containing metadata for the data to be processed

curl -X POST https://api-vdp.instill.tech/v1alpha/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer instill_sk_...' -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "texts": [
        "once upon a time"
      ],
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "https://artifacts.instill.tech/imgs/dog.jpg"
        }
      ],
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ]
}

```

  We have standardised the input and output format of each AI task. Check out
  the supported [AI task](/docs/core-concepts/ai-task).

## Use Instill Model on Instill Cloud

We deploy our source available product [Instill Model](https://github.com/instill-ai/model) on Instill Cloud.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Notice">

You may find that _importing your own models_ are disabled in the Model Hub of Instill Cloud. It is because
we are rapidly refactoring Model service to offer a more stable user
experience.

### Get access to pre-trained ML models

Deploying and maintaining ML models in a production environment is hard!
It often takes more effort and a lot longer to deploy a model to production than to develop it offline.
Therefore, we have deployed a list of pre-trained ML models on Instill Cloud. They are ready for use and are totally free during Open Alpha.

On the Instill Cloud console, click **Model Hub** to access all the pre-deployed ML models for different AI tasks.
A model in the Model Hub is an algorithm run on unstructured data to solve a certain [AI task](/docs/core-concepts/ai-task).

To get the details of a specific model, click on the model ID and see the **Description** and **Setting** sections.
To import the model into VDP, check out the VDP documentation on [Instill Model AI connector](/docs/vdp/ai-connectors/instill-model).
