No matter where your model stores, we want to keep your models in the same place without changes and make the process of importing the models into Instill Model very easy.
That's why Instill Model has integrated many model platforms and tools as _model sources_. We strive to support as many popular _model sources_ as possible.

A _model source_ in Instill Model is defined by [`ModelDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/model/model/v1alpha/model_definition.proto).
The JSON Schema of a `ModelDefinition` defines how to configure and import a _model source_.
Different approaches can provide different features. For example, some approaches support version control but some do not.
It is up to the users to adopt approach they are already familiar with.
