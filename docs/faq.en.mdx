## Essentials

    <summary>**Why do you build Instill Core?**</summary>

    The modern data stack lacks unstructured data processing capabilities.

    Processing unstructured data is challenging. We struggled with connecting data from different sources, developing deep learning models, deploying them, managing day-to-day operations, and continually building MLOps tools to maintain pipeline resilience and consistent AI performance. All of this was done in-house and was not scalable.

    There must be a better way, and [üîÆ Instill Core](welcome#instill-core) is the solution.

    To make AI accessible to everyone, the focus should not only be on algorithms (i.e., AI models) but also on the infrastructure tools that connect these algorithms with the modern data stack end-to-end.

    For a more detailed narrative, read our blog articles "[Why Instill AI exists](/blog/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link)" and "[Missing piece in modern data stack: unstructured data ETL](/blog/unstructured-data-etl/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link)".

    <summary>**Who are behind Instill Core?**</summary>

    We are a nimble team formed by members working for years in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, large-scale database, and cloud-native applications/infrastructure.
    We have in-depth experience in developing and maintaining sophisticated AI systems.

    Before we started to build Instill Core, we had fought with streaming large volume data (billions of images a day!) to automate Vision tasks using deep learning models, sweating blood to build everything from scratch.

    We have learned that model serving for an effective end-to-end data flow concerns not only **high throughput** and **low latency** but also **cost effectiveness**. These criteria are non-trivial to achieve altogether.
    In the end, we had successfully built a battle-proven AI system in-house and had the system run in production for years.

    What we had built can actually be modularised into working components to benefit a broader spectrum of AI tasks and industry sectors.
    We believe it's time to apply our experiences to make AI more accessible to everyone, especially the data industry.

    <summary>**Is Instill Core open source?**</summary>

    Instill Core uses multiple licenses, including Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2) and open-source MIT License.
    Our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone. The best way to achieve this is to make Instill Core free to use and source available to everyone, while ensuring we safely create a sustainable business.
    Please check the [Instill Core License](license) in detail.

## Tech

<ToggleBlock>
  <details> 
    <summary>**What programming language does Instill Core use or support?**</summary>

    Instill Core's backend components are Go-based and frontend console is written in Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

    Nonetheless, Instill Core is API-first and cloud-native. You can use cURL or the protobuf auto-generated codes to work with Instill Core. More developer-friendly multi-language SDKs are on our future roadmap.

    <summary>**What design principles does Instill Core adopt?**</summary>

    - [Microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) architecture makes Instill Core to be extensible, flexible and reusable for scenarios where new components are constantly added in Instill Core.
      The overall microservice system can be also very efficient at scaling phase to scale each backend instances based on their individual workload.

    - [IDEALS](https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-design-ideals) (**I**nterface segregation, **D**eployability, **E**vent-driven, **A**vailability over consistency, **L**oose coupling, and **S**ingle responsibility) design principle sets a rigorous framework when there comes to any Instill Core design questions in our day-to-day development.

    - [API-first](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach) approach comes naturally with the adoption of microservice and IDEALS. All backend components in Instill Core are implemented with API-first design principle so the contract is firmly established for whatever necessary integration task coming in the future.

    - [The twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net) provides a down-to-earth guideline for the development and deployment of Instill Core components.

    Building an effective and efficient machine learning product requires implementing the cutting-edge best practices of MLOps.
    There are many essential components involved in the MLOps cycle, and notably, these components are still evolving.

    We believe tooling development in AI and Data industry is marching toward a completely modularisation future, meaning that components in MLOps need to take into account flexibility, extensibility and composability as the first-class citizen as far as the design principle goes.

## Anecdote

<ToggleBlock>
  <details> 
    <summary>**Why is the company named Instill AI?**</summary>

    We have been attempting to land AI products ever since the surge of deep learning in 2014.
    On the way, we have learned how challenging this can be. To build effective AI products, educate the market about the AI, and eventually see the AI products helping people in real life.
    It is fair to say that we, the whole industry, still have a long way to go.

    We are enthusiastic about being on the journey, to instill the AI technologies gradually to the industry.

    The name is also inspired by a Chinese poem "Delighting in Rain on a Spring Night (Êò•Â§úÂñúÈõ®)" by Du Fu (ÊùúÁî´), particularly for reifying the word "instill":

    > Â•ΩÈõ®Áü•ÊôÇÁØÄÔºåÁï∂Êò•‰πÉÁôºÁîü„ÄÇ
    > Èö®È¢®ÊΩõÂÖ•Â§úÔºåÊΩ§Áâ©Á¥∞ÁÑ°ËÅ≤„ÄÇ
    > ÈáéÂæëÈõ≤‰ø±ÈªëÔºåÊ±üËàπÁÅ´Áç®Êòé„ÄÇ
    > ÊõâÁúãÁ¥ÖÊøïËôïÔºåËä±ÈáçÈå¶ÂÆòÂüé„ÄÇ

    It's pretty hard to have this poem precisely translated in English, but anyway the main idea is to express how delightful when hard working finally pays off.
