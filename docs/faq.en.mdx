    <summary>**Why do you build 🔮 Instill Core?**</summary>

    The modern data stack lacks unstructured data processing capabilities.

    Processing unstructured data is challenging. We struggled with connecting data
    from different sources, developing deep learning models, deploying them,
    managing day-to-day operations, and continually building MLOps tools to maintain
    pipeline resilience and consistent AI performance. All of this was done in-house
    and was not scalable.

    There must be a better way, and 🔮 [**Instill Core**](./core/introduction) is
    the solution.

    To make AI accessible to everyone, the focus should not only be on algorithms
    (i.e., AI models) but also on the infrastructure tools that connect these
    algorithms with the modern data stack end-to-end.

    <summary>**Who are behind 🔮 Instill Core?**</summary>

    Our team is composed of agile professionals with years of experience in Computer
    Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, large-scale databases, and cloud-native
    applications/infrastructure. We possess extensive knowledge in creating and
    managing complex AI systems.

    Prior to the development of **🔮 Instill Core**, we grappled with the challenge
    of streaming large volumes of data (billions of images daily!) to automate
    Vision tasks using deep learning models, painstakingly building everything from
    the ground up.

    We've learned that effective model serving for a seamless end-to-end data flow
    not only requires **high throughput** and **low latency**, but also
    **cost-effectiveness**. Achieving these criteria simultaneously is no easy feat.
    Eventually, we successfully constructed a robust AI system in-house that has
    been operational for years.

    The system we built can be broken down into functional components that can be
    utilized across a wide range of AI tasks and industries. We believe it's time to
    leverage our experience to make AI more accessible to everyone, particularly
    those in the data industry.

## Tech

<ToggleBlock>
  <details> 
    <summary>**What programming language does 🔮 Instill Core use or support?**</summary>

    **🔮 Instill Core**'s backend components are Go-based and frontend console is
    written in Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

    However, **🔮 Instill Core** is designed with an API-first and cloud-native
    approach. It can be interacted with using cURL or the auto-generated codes from
    protobuf. We also offer Python and TypeScript SDKs to help users incorporate
    **🔮 Instill Core** into their current technology stack. Plans to develop more
    user-friendly SDKs in multiple languages are in our future roadmap.

  <details> 
    <summary>**What design principles does 🔮 Instill Core adopt?**</summary>

    The **🔮 Instill Core** leverages the
    [Microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) architecture, making
    it adaptable, versatile, and reusable, especially in situations where new
    components are continuously integrated. This architecture also enhances
    scalability, allowing each backend instance to scale based on its specific
    workload.

    The [IDEALS](https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-design-ideals)
    (**I**nterface segregation, **D**eployability, **E**vent-driven,
    **A**vailability over consistency, **L**oose coupling, and **S**ingle
    responsibility) design principle provides a stringent framework for addressing
    design queries during the development of **🔮 Instill Core**.

    The
    [API-first](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach)
    approach is a natural outcome of adopting the microservice architecture and
    IDEALS. All backend components in **🔮 Instill Core** are designed with the
    API-first principle, ensuring a solid contract for future integration tasks.

    The [twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net) offers practical
    guidelines for the development and deployment of **🔮 Instill Core** components.

    We envision a future where AI and Data industry tooling development is fully
    modularized. This means that MLOps components should prioritize flexibility,
    extensibility, and composability in their design principles.

## Anecdote

  <details> 
    <summary>**Why is the company named Instill AI?**</summary>

    Our journey in the AI industry began with the rise of deep learning in 2014.
    Since then, we've realized the immense challenges involved in creating effective
    AI products, educating the market about AI, and witnessing the real-life impact
    of these products. It's clear that we, along with the rest of the industry,
    still have a significant path to tread.

    We're passionate about this journey, about gradually infusing AI technologies
    into the industry.

    Our name is also influenced by a Chinese poem "Delighting in Rain on a Spring
    Night (春夜喜雨)" by Du Fu (杜甫), specifically the concept of "instill":

    > 好雨知時節，當春乃發生。隨風潛入夜，潤物細無聲。野徑雲俱黑，江船火獨明。曉看紅
    > 濕處，花重錦官城。

    While it's challenging to translate this poem accurately into English, the
    central theme is the joy experienced when hard work eventually yields results.
