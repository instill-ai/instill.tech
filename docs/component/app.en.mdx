**Application** components are designed to establish seamless connections with a
wide range of applications. This includes, but is not limited to, webpages,
Slack, Gmail, Notion, and even blockchains. By leveraging the **Application**
component, users can easily integrate these applications into their data
pipelines, enabling efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading. This
facilitates the flow of data between different platforms, thereby enhancing the
overall data management process and enabling users to derive valuable insights
from their unstructured data.
