## About the project

A component serves as an essential building block in the construction of a
pipeline within **üíß Instill VDP**. The system provides a diverse range of
components, each designed to cater to distinct functionalities. These components
enhance the capabilities of pipelines, enabling them to effectively perform ETL
(Extract, Transform, Load) operations on unstructured data.

## Generic

**Generic** components serve as the
fundamental elements. They provide the necessary controls and operations for
data flow management, including but not limited to looping, failover, filtering,
sorting, and merging. These **Generic** components form the foundation upon
which more complex components are constructed.

## AI

**AI** components play a crucial role in transforming unstructured data into
formats that are easy to interpret and analyze, thereby facilitating the
extraction of valuable insights. These components integrate with AI models from
various providers, whether it's the primary **‚öóÔ∏è Instill Model** or those from
third-party AI vendors.

## Data

**Data** components are engineered to effortlessly integrate with a wide range
of data providers. They provide users with the essential tools to forge
connections with numerous data providers and vendors, making the data extraction
and loading process more straightforward. **üíß Instill VDP** utilizes these
**Data** components to extract data, transform it using **AI** components, and
subsequently deliver the processed data to the intended destinations.

## Application

**Application** components are designed to establish seamless connections with a
wide range of applications. This includes, but is not limited to, webpages,
Slack, Gmail, Notion, and even blockchains. By leveraging the **Application**
component, users can easily integrate these applications into their data
pipelines, enabling efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading. This
facilitates the flow of data between different platforms, thereby enhancing the
overall data management process and enabling users to derive valuable insights
from their unstructured data.

## Operator

**Operator** components are designed to provide a more flexible and detailed
approach to data handling and manipulation. It empowers users to execute custom
code without the necessity for server management or pre-provisioning. This
feature allows for on-demand code execution, triggered whenever data is piped
into the connector, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the data
pipeline.

## Component framework

**üîÆ Instill Core** provides a standardized structure for creating components.
It uses the
[`ComponentDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/pipeline/v1beta/component_definition.proto)
to outline the fundamental attributes and intricate configuration of a
component. For further details, please consult the
[component](https://github.com/instill-ai/component) repository.
