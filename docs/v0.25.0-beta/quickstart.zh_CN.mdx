Instill Core or Instill Cloud empowers you to build pipelines tailored for processing unstructured data using Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP).
The central concept in VDP is the Pipeline, which automates a sequence of components to process unstructured data.

## Build Your First AI Workflow

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Prerequisites">

To get started with this tutorial, you'll need both an OpenAI account and a Stability AI account. Here's how to set them up:

- Create an OpenAI account by visiting [openai.com](https://openai.com). Access to your API keys can then be managed through OpenAI's Account page.
- Create a Stability AI account by visiting [dreamstudio.ai](https://dreamstudio.ai). Access to your API keys can then be managed through DreamStudio's Account page. All new users are granted 25 free credits upon creating an account.

### Build the Pipeline

In this guide, we'll walk you through creating your first AI pipeline,
specifically focusing on a generative pipeline using the [OpenAI](./vdp/ai-connectors/openai) and [Stability AI](./vdp/ai-connectors/stability-ai) Connectors to generate digital stickers.

**Step 1: Create Connector**

Begin by navigating to the **Connectors** page on the navbar.
Since you haven't set up any pipelines yet, this page will be empty.

To set up an OpenAI connector resource, follow these steps:

1. Click on **+ Create Connector**, add select **OpenAI** on the Modal.
2. Provide a unique ID for the resource. Here we use _openai_. Optionally, you can add a description.
3. Fill in the **API Key**. Follow the OpenAI [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) to find your API key.
4. Optionally, specify which organization is used for the request.
5. Click **Save**.

Next, set up a Stability AI connector resource:

1. Click on **+ Create Connector**, add select **Stability AI** on the Modal.
2. Assign a unique ID for the resource. Here we use _stability-ai_, and you can optionally add a description.
3. Provide the **API Key**. Follow the Stability AI [documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication) to find your API key.
4. Click **Save**.

**Step 2: Build the Pipeline in the No-code Pipeline Builder**

Now, head to the **Pipelines** page on the navbar.
To create your first pipeline through the Console:

1. Click on **+ Create Pipeline**.
2. Assign a unique ID for the pipeline. Here we use _digital-sticker-maker_, and you can optionally add a description. By default, the owner of the pipeline is your account. But you can also assign it to an organization that you are a member of.
3. Choose the visibility of the pipeline. By default, the pipeline is private, but you can also make it public, so that it can be seen by anyone.
4. Click **Create**. 

This will redirect you to the no-code pipeline builder.
On the canvas, you can drag and drop connectors and operators to construct your pipeline.

By default, the Start Component and End Component are already added to the canvas.
The Start Component serves as the starting point of a VDP pipeline, where you can define the input data for your application.

To set up a Start component:

1. Locate the **start** component on canvas
2. Click **Add Field +** and select **Text**. Fill in the **Title** with _Prompt_. The reference key for this field will be _prompt_. Click **Save**.
3. Click **Add Field +** and select **Text**, Fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_. Similarly, the reference key for this field will be _sticker_shape_. Click **Save**.

This configuration requires two inputs: a prompt to generate the idea for the sticker and a shape parameter to control the sticker's appearance.

To configure an OpenAI connector:

1. Click **+ Add Component** and choose **openai** from the **Existing Connectors**. This will add a OpenAI connector `openai_0` to the canvas.
2. Select _TASK_TEXT_GENERATION_ from the dropdown of the **OpenAI Component** field.
3. Choose **Model** to choose the model to use, e.g., _gpt-3.5-turbo_.
4. In the **Prompt** field, specify the text prompt to generate an LLM augmented prompt:

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="Pipeline Component Reference">
  When establishing connections between components, referencing a component field is as simple as using `${}`.
  When you enter `${` into an input field, the smart hint feature intelligently filters and presents only the relevant hints that are compatible with the field.
</InfoBlock>

```
Augment the prompt with descriptive details for generating sticker images, and add the styles exactly at the end of the prompt "sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${start.sticker_shape} sticker with white border".
Only return the output content.

Prompt: a bear
Output: a brown bear dancing in a forest, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${start.sticker_shape} sticker with white border
Prompt: a dog writes code
Output: a dog writes code in front of a laptop and drinks coffee, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut ${start.sticker_shape} sticker with white border
Prompt: ${start.prompt}
Output:
```


5. Click the **More** link on the `openai_0` connector to open configuration right panel.
6. Fill **System Message** to set the behavior of the model. Here we set the value to:

```
You are a prompt engineer to generate Stable Diffusion prompts to generate sticker images.
```

7. Fill **Temperature** with a number between 0 and 2 to control how random the generation is, e.g., _1_.
8. Set **n** to in the _1_ to indicate only one chat completion.

The OpenAI connector will automatically link to the Start component
since we have used `${start.sticker_shape}` and `${start.prompt}` in the OpenAI connector configuration.
The `${}` placeholders represent **string values** to be filled during pipeline triggering.

To set up an Stability AI connector:

1. Click **+ Add Component** and choose **stability-ai** from existing resource. This will add a OpenAI connector `stability_0` to the canvas.
2. Select _TASK_TEXT_TO_IMAGE_ from the dropdown of the **Stability AI Component** field.
3. Choose the **Engine** to use, e.g., _stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0_.
4. In the **Prompts** field, specify the generated text array from the OpenAI connector output `${openai_0.output.texts}`.
5. Click the **More** link on the `stability_0` component to open configuration right panel.
6. Update the **width** to _1024_ and the **height** to _1024_ to set the resolution of the generated image.
6. Adjust **CFG Scale** to control how strictly the diffusion process adheres to the text prompt, e.g., set it to _8_.
7. Set **Samples** to _1_ to indicate generating only one image.
8. Specify a **Seed** with _0_ for a randomization.
9. Fill **Steps** to _30_ to indicate the number of diffusion steps to run.

You will see that the Stability AI connector is automatically linked to the OpenAI connector
since we have used `${openai_0.output.texts}` in the Stability AI connector configuration.

The End Component is used at the end of a VDP pipeline to receive the output as a response when triggering the pipeline.

To set up an End component:

1. Find the **end** component on canvas.
2. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _My Original Prompt_, the reference key for this field will be _my_original_prompt_, and **Value** with `${start.prompt}`. Click **Save**.
3. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Sticker Shape_, the reference key for this field will be _sticker_shape_, and **Value** with `${start.sticker_shape}`. Click **Save**.
4. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _LLM Powered Prompt_, the reference key for this field will be _llm_powered_prompt_, and **Value** with `${openai_0.output.texts}`. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Add Field +** and fill in the **Title** with _Digital Sticker_, the reference key for this field will be _digital_sticker_, and **Value** with `${stability_0.output.images}`. Click **Save**.

You will see that the End component is automatically linked to multiple components: `start`, `openai_0` and `stability_0`.

Click **Save** on the top right corner, and your pipeline is ready to be tested.

### Test the Pipeline via No-Code

🎉 Congratulations! Your first VDP pipeline is all set up and ready to go.

You can now put your pipeline to the test using real data. For instance, let's create a sticker featuring a yellow plane in the sky.

```
Prompt: yellow plane on the sky
Shape: round
```

Now, simply click on the **Run** button located in the top right corner.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core/test-pipeline.png"
  alt="Test the pipeline with real data"
/>

Click the Output tab of the `openai_0` component to view the generated output.
As you can see, the OpenAI ChatGPT model has expanded our initial prompt, turning it into:

```
a bright yellow vintage plane flying through a fluffy white cloud-filled sky, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut round sticker with white border
```

Give it a try!

### Use the Pipeline via Low-Code

In order to trigger the pipeline, you need a valid API token.
If you don't have one yet, follow these steps:

1. Click on the profile icon on the top right corner of the main page in the console and select **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page.
3. Click **Create Token** and give it an ID.

The API tokens do not expire, so keep them safe.
If a token is compromised, select it and click **Delete**.
Be cautious, as this operation cannot be undone, and apps using the token will stop working.

VDP automatically generates a dedicated trigger endpoint for each pipeline to process data.
To trigger the pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Toolkit* button on the top right corner of the pipeline canvas.
2. Copy the cURL request in the **Trigger Snippet** section and pass your API token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header
3. Adjust and ingest your data accordingly in the example request

Here is an example trigger request for the pipeline:

```shellscript

curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/vdp/v1beta/users/<user-id>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data  '{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"prompt": "yellow plane on the sky",
			"sticker_shape": "round"
		}
	]
}'

```

Where `<user-id>` represents your username, and `<pipeline-id>` corresponds to the pipeline ID.

You should receive the following response:

```shellscript
{
    "outputs": [
        {
            "digital_sticker": [
                "iVBORw0KGgo...SUVORK5CYII="
            ],
            "llm_powered_prompt": [
                "a bright yellow vintage plane flying through a fluffy white cloud-filled sky, sticker style, flat icon, vector, die-cut round sticker with white border"
            ],
            "prompt": "yellow plane on the sky",
            "sticker_shape": "round"
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "traces": {...}
    }
}
```

To obtain the generated image, decode the "digital_sticker" field of the response from Base64 format.
