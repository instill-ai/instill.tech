The Pinecone Data Connector allows users to store and query text embeddings as vectors. Users can then perform similarity search operations on stored vectors.

## Release stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

There are two things needed to configure a Pinecone connector: Pinecone URL (corresponding to your index) and an API key. Firstly, users need to create an index on https://www.pinecone.io. Once an index is created, the URL and API key can be used to configure a connector as mentioned below -
For the up-to-date configuration, refer to [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector/blob/main/pkg/pinecone/config/definitions.json).

| Field     | Type   | Note                            |
| :-------- | :----- | :------------------------------ |
| url\*     | string | Fill your Pinecone url here     |
| api_key\* | string | Fill your Pinecone api_key here |

### No-code Setup

To create a Pinecone data connector effortlessly, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Resource** page and click **Add Resource**
2. Select **Pinecone**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Optionally, give a short description in the **Description** field

### Low-code Setup

For advanced users who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a Pinecone data connector using the following cURL commands:

1. Create a Pinecone data connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl  --location http://localhost:8080/vdp/v1alpha/users/<user-id>/connectors
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Your-API-Token>' \
      --data '{
        "id": "pinecone",
        "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/data-pinecone",
        "description": "The Pinecone vector database",
        "configuration": {
          "url": <Pinecone host address>,
          "api_key": <api key>
        }
      }'
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Supported Tasks

The Pinecone connector supports two tasks: **Upsert** and **Query**.

1. **Upsert** - use this to insert a new vector embedding or modify existing ones. It accepts an array of vectors `values` as a required parameter. Where each vector is an object with an `id` and an array of floating point numbers.

   Ref: https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/upsert

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "values": [1.35, -1.3, 1.356, 0.356, ...]
}
```

2. **Query** - use this to perform a similarity search on stored vectors. It requires 2 parameters: `top_k` - the number of matches to return, and `vector` - the query vector which is an array of floating point numbers.

   Ref: https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/query

```json
{
  "top_k": 5,
  "vector": [1.35, -1.3, 1.356, 0.356, ...]
}
```
