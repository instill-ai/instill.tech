**🔮 Instill Core** or **☁️ Instill Cloud** empowers you to build pipelines
tailored for processing unstructured data using the Versatile Data Pipeline
(**💧 Instill VDP**). The central concept in **💧 Instill VDP** is the Pipeline,
which automates a sequence of components to process unstructured data.

## Run Your First AI Workflow

Once you login you will automatically be taken to the Instill Hub, where you can
explore public **💧 Instill VDP** pipelines developed by the community and the
Instill AI team.

1. Search for and select the `quickstart` pipeline.
2. Type in a prompt in the `Sticker Prompt` field.
3. Click the `Run` button.
     
Congratulations 🎉 you have successfully run your first **💧 Instill VDP**
pipeline!

This pipeline generates stickers based on the text prompt you provide. The **📺
Instill Console** window on the left side of the screen displays all of the
components within this pipeline, and how they are connected. You can inspect
them by using the `+` icons to expand them.

From this you can see how the pipeline takes an initial text prompt from the
user, enhances the prompt to be more descriptive using the Llama3-8b-Instruct
model, and then generates a sticker using Stable-Diffusion-XL. It utilises **⚗️
Instill Model** [AI components](./component/ai/instill) to connect to a growing
list of pretrained models that are served and ready for requests on **☁️ Instill
Cloud**. 

<InfoBlock type="info" title="Instill Credit">
  With your **☁️ Instill Cloud** account, you'll receive **10,000 monthly
  Instill Credits** which will allow you to not only use **⚗️ Instill Model**
  components, but also connect to third party vendors such as OpenAI, all
  without the hassle of setting up individual accounts with these services.

## Customize Your AI Workflow

You may have noticed that you are unable to edit this pipeline. To customise a
public pipeline to suit your own requirements, you simply need to clone it.

### Step 1. Clone Your Pipeline

1. Select the `Clone` button.
2. Specify a name for the pipeline and provide a short description.
3. Ensure the pipeline has the desired visibility.
4. Click the `Clone` button.

### Step 2. Edit with 📺 Instill Console

Now you will be able to select `Edit` (next to the `Clone` button) to begin
customising. This will bring up the **📺 Instill Console** no-code pipeline
builder.

To test out your cloned pipeline, simply enter a `Sticker Prompt` and hit `Run`.

  alt="Running in the Console"

From here you can edit, add and remove components, as well as change how they
connect together!

For instance, to edit one of the AI components in this
**💧 Instill VDP** pipeline you could:
- Select a different model using the `Model Name` dropdown.
- Optimise the `Prompt` for your use case.
- Select `More` to customise task-specific inference variables that control the
   behaviour of the model (e.g. system message or temperature).
