VDP (Alpha) is currently under rapid development.
The system architecture shown below is subject to change but will always follow the general guidance described in [Tech](/docs/vdp/faq#tech).
We welcome feedback and please feel free to raise a proposal in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions).
