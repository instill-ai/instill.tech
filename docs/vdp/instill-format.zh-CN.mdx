description: "Instill Format in VDP"
---

VDP defines the Instill Format as the data type identifier, ensuring consistency and compatibility across components.
Each input field in a component will define `instillAcceptFormats`, specifying the data types it can accept.
Conversely, each output field will define `instillFormat`, indicating the data type it produces.
The VDP reference system ensures that all input fields reference the correct data types, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the data pipeline.

VDP extends the Instill Format from the JSON primitive types and [MIME types (IANA media types)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).

**JSON Primitive Types**:
- `string`
- `number`
- `integer`
- `boolean`
- `object`
- `array`

**MIME Types**:
- `text/*`: All kinds of text data, such as `text/html`
- `image/*`: All kinds of image data, such as `image/jpeg`
- `video/*`: All kinds of video data, such as `video/h264`
- `audio/*`: All kinds of audio data, such as `audio/wav`
- `application/*`: Other types of data, such as `application/pdf`

**Semi-structured Data Types**

- `semi-structured/json`: JSON data, which can include any JSON primitive types
- `semi-structured/object`

**Structured Data Types**

Structured data types are specifically designed for various advanced tasks, particularly in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

- `structured/chat_message`: Used in large language model (LLM) tasks
- `structured/multi_modal_content`: Used in LLM tasks
- `structured/bounding_box`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/detection_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/instance_segmentation_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/keypoint_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/ocr_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/semantic_segmentation_stuff`: Used in CV tasks

By adhering to these formats, VDP ensures that data is processed correctly and efficiently, enabling users to build robust and scalable data pipelines.
The use of standardized data types also facilitates easier integration and interoperability between different components and systems within the VDP.
