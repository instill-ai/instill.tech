**ðŸ’§ Instill VDP** defines the **Instill Format** as the data type identifier,
ensuring consistency and compatibility across components. Each input field in a
component will define `instillAcceptFormats`, specifying the data types the
component can accept. Conversely, each output field will define `instillFormat`,
indicating the data type the component produces. The design of **ðŸ’§ Instill
VDP** reference system ensures that all input fields reference the correct data
types, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the data pipeline.

VDP extends the Instill Format from the JSON primitive types and [MIME types
(IANA media
types)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).

**JSON Primitive Types**:

- `string`
- `number`
- `integer`
- `boolean`
- `object`
- `array`

**MIME Types**:

- `text/*`: All kinds of text data, such as `text/html`
- `image/*`: All kinds of image data, such as `image/jpeg`
- `video/*`: All kinds of video data, such as `video/h264`
- `audio/*`: All kinds of audio data, such as `audio/wav`
- `application/*`: Other types of data, such as `application/pdf`

**Semi-structured Data Types**

- `semi-structured/json`: JSON data, which can include any JSON primitive types
- `semi-structured/object`

**Structured Data Types**

Structured data types are specifically designed for various advanced tasks,
particularly in the fields of Large Language Model (LLM) and Computer Vision
(CV).

- `structured/chat_message`: Used in LLM tasks
- `structured/multi_modal_content`: Used in LLM tasks
- `structured/bounding_box`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/detection_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/instance_segmentation_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/keypoint_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/ocr_object`: Used in CV tasks
- `structured/semantic_segmentation_stuff`: Used in CV tasks

By adhering to these formats, **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP** ensures accurate and efficient
data processing, enabling users to construct robust and scalable unstructured
data pipelines. The utilization of standardized data types also promotes
seamless integration and interoperability among various components and systems
within the **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP**.
