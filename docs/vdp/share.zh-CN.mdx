{/* Move to Instill Cloud */}

**☁️ Instill Cloud** offers the capability to disseminate your creations either
via a direct link or by setting them to public visibility. This allows other
users to view and clone your shared pipeline into their respective **☁️ Instill
Cloud** accounts.

Follow the steps below to share your pipeline:

1. **Preserve your progress**: Once you've completed the pipeline construction,
   press the `Save` button situated in the top-right corner.
2. **Access sharing settings**: Click the `Share` button, also positioned in the
   top-right corner.
3. **Sharing link**:
   - To distribute via a link, press `Copy Link` to copy the pipeline's URL to
     your clipboard.
4. **Publish the pipeline**:
   - To transition a private pipeline to public visibility, press the `Publish` tab at
     the top of the pop-up window, followed by the `Publish` button once more.
   - Your pipeline will then be publicly accessible in the **Hub** page.
5. **Revert to private**:
   - You can also revert a public pipeline back to private status by following
     similar steps as for publishing but now pressing the `Unpublish` button.
     This ensures your pipeline is returned to private visibility.

These options offer versatility in how you control and distribute your creations
within the Instill community.
