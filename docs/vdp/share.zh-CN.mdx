You can share your creations on Instill Cloud either through a link or by making them publicly accessible. Other users can then view and clone your shared pipeline into their own Instill Cloud account.

Hereâ€™s how to share your pipeline:

1. **Save Your Work**: After you've finished building your pipeline, click the `Save` button in the top-right corner.
2. **Open Sharing Options**: Click the `Share` button, also located in the top-right corner.
3. **Share by Link**:
   - To share via a link, click `Copy Sharable Link` to copy the URL of the pipeline to your clipboard.
4. **Make Public**:
   - If you wish to make a private pipeline public, click "Publish" at the top of the pop-up window, then `Publish` again.
   - Provide optional metadata, including a short description and detailed pipeline description, then click `Publish Pipeline`. Your pipeline will become public and visible on Instill Hub.
5. **Unpublish a Pipeline**:
   - You can also unpublish a public pipeline by following similar steps as for publishing, ensuring your pipeline is returned to private status.
These options provide flexibility in how you manage and share your creations with the Instill community.
