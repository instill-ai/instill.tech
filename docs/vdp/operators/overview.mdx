To facilitate more flexible and fine-grained data injection and manipulation, **Operators** allow users to run customized code without the need for server management or pre-provisioning.
This enables code execution whenever the pipeline is triggered and data flows into the connector.

Currently, VDP supports the following operators:

- [**Trigger**](trigger)
- [**Response**](response)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new operator**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions), or request it in the **#vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
