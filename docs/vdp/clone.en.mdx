Leveraging an existing pipeline by cloning it provides a solid starting point,
eliminating the need to build from the ground up. This cloned pipeline can be
tailored to your specific requirements, facilitating quick deployment and
experimentation.

To clone a pipeline on Instill Hub, adhere to the following procedure:

1. Visit **Instill Hub** and identify a pipeline that piques your interest.
2. Press the `Clone` button situated at the bottom of the
   pipeline. Alternatively, you can initiate cloning from the Pipeline Preview
   Page if you accessed the pipeline via a shared link or after executing it
   (refer to [this guide](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/run) to learn how to
   run another user's pipeline).
3. In **Clone this pipeline** dialog, fill in the following details:

   - **Owner**: Determine the cloned pipeline to be under your personal
     account or organization account.
   - **Pipeline Name**: Assign a unique identifier to your new pipeline.
   - **Description**: Optionally, provide additional information about the
     pipeline.
   - **Visibility**: Determine whether your pipeline should be public or
     private.

4. Press `Clone` to complete the operation and begin
   utilizing or modifying the pipeline as necessary.
