Cloning another user's pipeline enables you to start with a proven framework, saving time and effort in building from scratch. You can customize them for your specific needs by modifying and extending a cloned pipeline, allowing for rapid deployment and experimentation.

To clone another's pipeline on Instill Hub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Instill Hub and locate a pipeline that interests you.
2. **Initiate Cloning**: Click the `Clone` button located at the bottom of the pipeline. You can also clone from the Pipeline Preview Page if you accessed the pipeline through a shared link or after running it (learn how to run another user's pipeline [here](test)).
3. **Configure Settings**:

   - **Owner**: Select whether the cloned pipeline will be under your personal account or your organization's account.
   - **Pipeline Name**: Enter a name for your new pipeline.
   - **Description**: Optionally, add a description to give more context about the pipeline.
   - **Visibility**: Choose if you want your pipeline to be public or private.

4. **Complete Cloning**: Click `Clone` to finalize the process and start using or modifying the pipeline as needed.
