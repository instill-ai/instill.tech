TODO: test the recipes on this page

A **Pipeline** component is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.

It is defined by a `recipe` which is essentially a JSON object componsed of multiple components:

- Source connector - where the pipeline starts to ingest unstructured data to be processed
- AI, Blockchain connectors - a number of connectors to process the ingested unstructured data
- Destination connectors - a number of destinations to send the processed outputs in parallel

```json
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": <component-id>,
      "resource_name": <connector-resource-name>  // Source connector
    },
    {
      "id": <component-id>,
      "resource_name": <connector-resource-name>  // AI or Blockchain connector
    },
    ...
    {
      "id": <component-id>,
      "resource_name": <connector-resource-name> // Destination connector
    }
  ]
}
```

Depending on the use case, the user can create a pipeline in `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, or `PULL` mode. The pipeline mode is determined by the combination of selected source and destination. Continue to read for more details.

## Mode

### `SYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously.
The result is sent back to the user right after the data is processed.
This mode is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern.
The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

  alt="SYNC pipeline mode"
/>

To create a `SYNC` pipeline, both source and destination needs to be configured with the same protocol type. VDP supports HTTP and gRPC for a `SYNC` pipeline.

For example, this `recipe` defines a gRPC `SYNC` pipeline for real-time YOLOv7 inference:

```json
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "source",
      "resource_name": "connectors/source-grpc"
    },
    {
      "id": "ai",
      "resource_name": "connectors/yolov7-v1-cpu"
    },
    {
      "id": "destination",
      "resource_name": "connectors/destination-grpc"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `ASYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs asynchronous workload.
The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response.
Once the data has been processed, the result is sent to the data destination.
This mode is for use cases that do not require inference results immediately.

  src="/docs-assets/core-concepts/async.svg"
  alt="ASYNC pipeline mode"
/>

To create an `ASYNC` pipeline, the source can be either HTTP or gRPC, and the destination can be any Airbyte destination connectors.

For example, this `recipe` defines an`ASYNC` pipeline to detect images by YOLOv7 via HTTP request and write the structured detection output into a PostgreSQL database:

```json
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "source",
      "resource_name": "connectors/source-http"
    },
    {
      "id": "ai",
      "resource_name": "connectors/yolov7-v1-cpu"
    },
    {
      "id": "destination",
      "resource_name": "connectors/postgres"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `PULL` mode (coming soon!)

A pipeline in the `PULL` mode performs scheduled workload to regularly pull data
from the **Source** to process and write to destinations in the end.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/docs-assets/core-concepts/pull.svg"
  alt="Pipeline PULL mode"
/>

## State

When a pipeline is initially created, the pipeline state is determined by the pipeline's sub-components with the precedence:

- `ERROR` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their `ERROR` state
- `UNSPECIFIED` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their `UNSPECIFIED` state
- `INACTIVE` if **ANY** of its sub-components are in their negative state
- `ACTIVE` if **ALL** of its sub-components are in their positive state

A pipeline can be switched to `INACTIVE` state by invoking the `pipeline-backend` endpoint `/deactivate` only when its original state is `ACTIVE`.

A pipeline can be switched to `ACTIVE` state by invoking the `pipeline-backend` endpoint `/activate` only when its original state is `INACTIVE`.
