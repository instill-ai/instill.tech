A **Pipeline** is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.

It is defined by a `recipe` which is essentially a JSON object componsed of multiple components:

- Operators - where the pipeline starts to ingest data to be processed or returns data as response
- Connectors - a number of connectors to query, process, or send the ingested unstructured data

```json
{
  "version": "v1alpha",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": <component-id>,
      "definition_name": <operator-definition-name>,  // Operator
      "configuration": {...},
      ...
    }
    {
      "id": <component-id>,
      "resource_name": <connector-resource-name>,
      "definition_name": <connector-definition-name>,  // Connector
      "configuration": {...},
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Inside the recipe, we have four important fields:
- `id`: a unique identifier inside the recipe
- `resource_name`: 
  - the connector resource, please refer to [AI Connectors](/docs/vdp/ai-connectors/overview), [Data Connectors](/docs/vdp/data-connectors/overview) or [Blockchain Connectors](/docs/vdp/blockchain-connectors/overview)
  - the format is `users/<user_id>/connector-resources/<connector-resource-id>`
- `definition_name`:
  - the connector or operator definition name
  - the format is `connector-definitions/<connector-definition-id>` or `operator-definitions/<operator-definition-id>`
- `configuration`: setting up the input data and parameters of the component


## Trigger pipeline

### Trigger via SYNC API

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously.
The result is sent back to the user right after the data is processed.
This is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern.
The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

VDP supports trigger a pipeline via HTTP and gRPC protocols.

### Trigger via ASYNC API

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs asynchronous workload.
The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response.
This mode is for use cases that requires long running workloads.

### Trigger via PULL schedular (coming soon)

A pipeline in the `PULL` mode performs scheduled workload to regularly pull data
from the **Source** to process and write to destinations in the end.
