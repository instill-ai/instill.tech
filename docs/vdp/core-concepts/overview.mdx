---

Modern data stack misses unstructured data processing.

[**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) is to fill in the missing piece. At a high-level perspective, VDP streamlines processing unstructured data from various data sources by AI models and sending results to pre-configured data destinations.

In other words, VDP is a tool to extract, transform and load (ETL) unstructured data to their meaningful representations.

To benefit a broader set of users and maximise the tool's usability and affordability, VDP is built with an open heart in each component:

## Pipeline

**Pipeline** consists of different types of Connectors, altogether defined in a `recipe`. A pipeline can be in either `SYNC` or `ASYNC` mode, depending on whether the pipeline workflow is time-critical or not. See [Pipeline](pipeline) for more details.

**Pipeline** is maintained in [pipeline-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend).

## Connector

**Connector** is the basic component to construct a pipeline. There are different types of pipelines, dpending on the functionalities.

Connector is created and maintained in [connector-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend).

### Source Connector

**Source Connector** is the component at the beginning of a VDP pipeline, which streams unstructured data (e.g., image, video, text, audio) from IoT devices (e.g., IP cameras) or cloud storage services (e.g., GCP Cloud Storage, AWS S3).

In VDP, the unstructured data source connectors are developed and maintained by the VDP community.

Source Connector is maintained in [connector-source](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-source).

### Destination Connector

**Destination Connector** is the component at the end of a VDP pipeline, which loads the structured data provided by the Model component to a target destination.

VDP implements [Airbyte Protocol](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol) to adopt Airbyte's 30+ destination connectors to write the structured data result from **Model** to the destination. VDP users can thus directly benefit from the abundant community resources from there to further perform data movement or transformation.
Future unstructured data destination connectors will be developped and maintained by the VDP community.

Destination Connector is maintained in [connector-destination](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-destination).

### AI Connector

**AI Connector** provides a framework to connect AI models for processing unstructured data from various sources,
no matter they come from third-party model providers or in-house model serving platforms.

This unlocks numerous opportunities for VDP to integrate with popular open model providers like OpenAI, Stability AI, Hugging Face, and, of course, Instill Model.

AI Connector is maintained in [connector-ai](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-ai).

### Blockchain Connector

**Blockchain Connector** integrates with Blockchain services to convert your data into Web3 assets.
A typical use case is to upload AI-generated or AI-assisted content on the blockchain to ensure transparency and trust in the ownership of the content and establish a tamper-proof record of the content's origin, creation, and subsequent modifications.

Blockchain Connector is maintained in [connector-blockchain](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-blockchain).

## Console

**Console** is a web-based UI application, designed to provide convenient access to Base, VDP and Model.
One of its key features is a _no-code_ drag-and-drop pipeline builder.
This means that even non-technical users can effortlessly build flexible VDP pipelines by simply dragging and dropping components.
By emphasizing simplicity and ease of use, the goal is to provide a unified and intuitive user experience.

Console is maintained in [console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console).

## API

VDP is implemented with **API-first** design principle. It enables seamless integration to your data stack at any scale.

VDP uses [Protocol Buffers version 3 (proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages.
The same interface definitions are used for both REST (via [gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)) and RPC. This enables the access to the API over different protocols:

- JSON over HTTP
- Protocol Buffers over gRPC

The interface definitions are maintained in [protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs) with auto-generated Go codes in [protogen-go](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-go) and Python code in [protogen-python](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-python).
The genuine protobuf documentation can be found in our [Buf Scheme Registry (BSR)](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Release stage

For Instill AI developed and maintained components, we use release stage defined as below to indicate their readiness:

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha**               | An alpha component indicates the component is under development and Instill AI is collecting its early feedback and issues reported by early adopters. We strongly discourage using alpha components for production.                                            |
| **Beta**                | A beta component is considered stable and reliable with no further backwards incompatible changes but has not been validated by a broader group of users. We expect to find and fix a few issues and bugs in the release before it is ready for the next stage. |
| **Generally Available** | A generally available component has been thoroughly tested in the battlefield and is ready for use in a production environment. Its documentation is considered sufficient to support widespread adoption.                                                      |
