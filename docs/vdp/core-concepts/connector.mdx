At the two ends of a VDP pipeline, there are **Source** component (i.e., the E in ETL) and **Destination** component (i.e., the L in ETL).

## Definition

VDP uses [`ConnectorDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/connector_definition.proto)
to define the basic properties and detailed configuration of a connector.
The inner field [`connector_definition.spec.connection_specification`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/spec.proto)
defines the connector configuration JSON Schema.

## Source

A **Source** component is a data connector in charge of ingesting unstructured data into **Pipeline**.

VDP supports HTTP and gRPC source connector for both `SYNC` and `ASYNC` pipelines.

Source connectors for the pipeline [`PULL`](pipeline#pull-mode-coming-soon) mode are coming soon.

## Destination

A **Destination** component is a data connector to write the standardised AI task output from **Model** to the destination data warehouse or notification.

VDP supports HTTP and gRPC destination connector for the `SYNC` pipeline.

For the `ASYNC` pipeline, VDP adopts [Airbyte Protocol](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol) to inject standardised AI task output from **Model** into the [AirbyteRecordMessage](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#airbyterecordmessage) JSON object, to employ Airbyte destination connectors.

Specifically, to trigger a destination connector's container [`write`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#write) operation,
`connector-backend` assembles the [ConfiguredAirbyteCatalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/beginners-guide-to-catalog/#configuredairbytecatalog) on the fly,
with the corresponding connector configuration JSON object used in [`check`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#check) operation,
to start a Temporal workflow to write the structured data to the destination.

As far as [Airbyte connections and sync modes](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/connections) are concerned, VDP currently supports `full_refresh` sync mode and `append` destination sync mode for an `ASYNC` pipeline.

VDP currently does not support Airbyte's [Namespaces](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/namespaces).

The release stages of destination connectors developed and maintained by Airbyte community are reported [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/#destinations).

## State

When a connector is initially created, the connector state is checked by the connector container `check` operation.

The exit code of the container `check` operation decides the connector state.
If the exit code is 0, the state will be `CONNECTED`.
If the exit code is 1, the state will be `ERROR`.
Before the container `check` return the result, the connector state will remain `UNSPECIFIED`.

A connector can be switched to `DISCONNECTED` state by invoking the `connector-backend` endpoint `/disconnect` only when its original state is `CONNECTED`.

A connector can be switched to `CONNECTED` state by invoking the `connector-backend` endpoint `/connect` only when its original state is `DISCONNECTED`.

If the connector state ends up with `ERROR`, the connector configuration will need to be updated via the UPDATE `connector-backend` endpoint.
