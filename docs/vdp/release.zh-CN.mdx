Version Control provides enhanced flexibility and management by enabling
tracking of modifications in your pipelines and applications over time. This
functionality empowers users to leverage various versions of the same pipeline
for purposes such as backup, recovery, A/B testing, among others.

To utilize this feature, adhere to the following procedure:

1. Select the `Release` option located in the top-right corner in the **Pipeline Builder** page.
2. Opt for a versioning format that adheres to semantic principles.
3. Optionally, provide a description.
4. To access prior versions, click on `Releases` and select an older version
   from the bottom-left corner.
