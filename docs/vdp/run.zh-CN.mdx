You can either execute your own pipeline on Pipeline Builder or operate another's pipeline through Pipeline Preview Page

To run another user's pipeline through the Pipeline Preview page on Instill Hub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Instill Hub and locate a pipeline that interests you.
2. Click on the title of the pipeline to access the Pipeline Preview Page.
3. Read the instructions or examples provided in the `Pipeline Description` section to understand how to use it.
4. Provide the necessary inputs or upload the required files to configure the pipeline.
5. Click the `Run` button to execute the pipeline and view the results.

### Running a Pipeline via API

Running a pipeline via API in VDP is straightforward. You can easily obtain the curl snippet from the Pipeline Builder interface under the **Toolkit -> Trigger Snippet** tab.

#### Example API Request

Please refer to [Introduction](../vdp/introduction) to learn how to setup the pipeline recipe.
For instance, if your pipeline defines a variable `prompt` and an output `text`, the API request command will be as follows:

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/v1beta/users/<user-id>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data '{
  "data": [
    {
      "variable": {
        "prompt": "hello world"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

This command sends a POST request to trigger the pipeline, with the variable `prompt` set to "hello world". 

#### Corresponding Response

The corresponding response for the above API request will be:

```json
{
  "output": [
    {
      "answer": "Hello user"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alternative Format

Previously, users could use a different format to send the request. However, this format is now deprecated and will be removed soon. It is recommended to update your API requests to the new format.

#### Deprecated API Request Format

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/v1beta/users/<user-id>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "prompt": "hello world"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Steps to Trigger a Pipeline

1. **Access the Pipeline Builder**:
   - Open the Pipeline Builder and navigate to **Toolkit -> Trigger Snippet** tab to generate the necessary curl snippet.

2. **Prepare the API Request**:
   - Ensure you have the correct API endpoint, user ID, pipeline ID, and API token.
   - Configure the data payload with the appropriate variables.

3. **Execute the API Request**:
   - Use the provided curl command to send a POST request to the VDP API endpoint.
   - Verify the response to ensure the pipeline is triggered successfully.


Please ensure you correctly setup the required values:
- **Authentication**: Ensure your API token is valid and has the necessary permissions to trigger the pipeline. You can generate the API Token in **Settings -> API Token**
- **Data Formatting**: Adhere to the JSON formatting standards specified in the API documentation.


By following these guidelines, you can seamlessly integrate pipeline triggering into your workflows.
