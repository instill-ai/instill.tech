A **Connector** is a fundamental building block used to construct a pipeline in VDP. The system offers various types of connectors, each catering to specific functionalities:

- [**AI Connector**](/docs/vdp/ai-connectors): Connect to remote models from model providers like Instill Model, OpenAI, Stability AI, etc.
- [**Blockchain Connector**](/docs/vdp/blockchain-connectors): Connect to Blockchain services like Numbers, etc.
- [**Data Connector**](/docs/vdp/data-connectors): Connect to remote data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Pinecone, etc.
- ...

Each type of connector requires specific configuration to connect to the respective remote service.

Connector is created and maintained in the [`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend) repository.

## Definition

VDP uses [`ConnectorDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/connector_definition.proto)
to define the basic properties and detailed configuration of a connector.
The inner field [`connector_definition.spec.connection_specification`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/spec.proto)
defines the connector configuration JSON Schema.

## State

When a connector is initially created, the connector state is checked by the connector container `check` operation.

The exit code of the container `check` operation decides the connector state.
If the exit code is 0, the state will be `CONNECTED`.
If the exit code is 1, the state will be `ERROR`.
Before the container `check` return the result, the connector state will remain `UNSPECIFIED`.

A connector can be switched to `DISCONNECTED` state by invoking the `connector-backend` endpoint `/disconnect` only when its original state is `CONNECTED`.

A connector can be switched to `CONNECTED` state by invoking the `connector-backend` endpoint `/connect` only when its original state is `DISCONNECTED`.

If the connector state ends up with `ERROR`, the connector configuration will need to be updated via the UPDATE `connector-backend` endpoint.
