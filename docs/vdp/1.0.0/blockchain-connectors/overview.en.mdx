The Blockchain Connector is to seamlessly integrate various 3rd-party Blockchain services, facilitating the conversion of data into Web3 assets.
With this connector, users can effortlessly upload AI-generated or AI-assisted content onto the blockchain, ensuring transparency, trust, and establishing a tamper-proof record of the content's origin, creation, and any subsequent modifications.

Here is a list of the supported Blockchain connectors that you can leverage for your projects.
You can find detailed information about each connector in the [connector-blockchain](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-blockchain) repository:
