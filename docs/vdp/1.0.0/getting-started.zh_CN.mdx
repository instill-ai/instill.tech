We've made it easy to get started with VDP either on a local machine.

## Local run

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="WARNING">
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the
  next release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version,
  use the [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/releases) instead.
</InfoBlock>

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose to run all services at local.

Get started locally by running:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
make all
```

Once the services are up, the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To shut down all running services:

```shellscript
make down
```

## Deploy on Kubernetes

Please follow the [instructions](/docs/vdp/deployment/kubernetes-using-helm) to deploy VDP on local Kubernetes using Helm.

## Start building with VDP

If this is your first time setting up VDP, access the Console (http://localhost:3000) and you should see the onboarding page. Please enter your email and you are all set!
