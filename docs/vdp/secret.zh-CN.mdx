In **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP**, certain components require the configuration of
credential data, such as passwords, API keys, and tokens. The protection and
privacy of these credentials are paramount. To prevent potential exposure of
sensitive data, VDP not only prohibits users from setting credential data as
plaintext within the recipe but also stores all credential data in a specified
secret space. This approach ensures that sensitive data is kept secure and
inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Users can manage their secrets by
navigating to **Console** > **Settings** > **Secrets**.

## Secret Reference

When setting up a pipeline, users can refer to stored secrets within component
configurations using a specific syntax. Rather than incorporating plaintext
credentials, users can securely load secret data by employing the following
syntax:

```text
${secret.my-secret-key}
```

This method ensures that the actual credential data is never exposed in the
pipeline configuration, maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

## Steps to Manage Secrets

1. Access the **Secrets** page:

   - Proceed to **Console** > **Settings** > **Secrets**.
   - This section provides a user-friendly interface for managing all your
     credential data.

2. Create a new secret:

   - Press the **Create Secret** button.
   - Input a unique key and the corresponding credential data.
   - Press the **Create Secret** button to save the secret to make it available
     for pipeline configurations.

3. Delete a secret:
   - Locate the secret you want to delete.
   - Press the `Delete` button to delete the secret.

By complying with these practices, **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP** ensures that all
credential data is managed securely, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access
and potential breaches. This method allows users to concentrate on constructing
and deploying robust data processing pipelines without jeopardizing security.
