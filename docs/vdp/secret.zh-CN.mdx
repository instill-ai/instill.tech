In VDP, certain components require the setup of credential data, such as passwords, API keys, and API tokens. Ensuring the security and confidentiality of these credentials is crucial. To prevent any potential leakage of sensitive information, VDP does not permit users to set credential data as plaintext within the recipe.

### Secure Storage of Credential Data

VDP force users to store all credential data in a designated secret space. This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. Users can manage their secrets by navigating to **Console -> Settings -> Secrets**. This section of the Console allows users to add and delete credentials securely.

### Referencing Secrets in VDP Pipelines

When configuring a VDP pipeline, users can reference stored secrets within component configurations using a specific syntax. Instead of embedding plaintext credentials, users can load secret data securely by utilizing the following syntax: 

```
${secret.my-secret-key}
```

This method ensures that the actual credential data is never exposed in the pipeline configuration, maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

### Steps to Manage Secrets

1. **Accessing the Secrets Management Console**:
   - Go to **Console -> Settings -> Secrets**.
   - This section provides a user-friendly interface for managing all your credential data.

2. **Adding a New Secret**:
   - Click on the **Create Secret** button.
   - Enter a unique key and the corresponding credential data.
   - Save the secret to make it available for pipeline configurations.

3. **Deleting a Secret**:
   - Locate the secret you want to delete.
   - Use the delete option to remove the secret from the storage.

By adhering to these practices, VDP ensures that all credential data is handled securely, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. This approach allows users to focus on building and deploying robust data processing pipelines without compromising security.
