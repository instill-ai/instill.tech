**Data Connectors** play a crucial role in establishing connections with remote data sources, such as IoT devices (e.g., IP cameras), cloud storage services (e.g., GCP Cloud Storage, AWS S3), data warehouses, or vector databases.

These connectors act as the bridge between VDP and various external data sources.
Their primary function is to enable seamless data exchange, enhancing VDP's capability to work with diverse data sources effectively.
The VDP community is continuously working to expand the range of available connectors.
Detailed information about each specific connector is available in the [connector-data](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-data) repository:
