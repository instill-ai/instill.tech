The Pinecone Data Connector allows users to store and query text embeddings as vectors. Users can then perform similarity search operations on stored vectors.

## Configuration

There are two things needed to configure a Pinecone connector: Pinecone URL (corresponding to your index) and an API key. Firstly, users need to create an index on https://www.pinecone.io. Once an index is created, the URL and API key can be used to configure a connector as mentioned below -

### No-code setup

To create a Pinecone data connector effortlessly, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Data** page and click **Set up new data connector**
2. Click the **Data connector type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **Pinecone**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Optionally, give a short description in the **Description** field

Now go to the **Data** page, the corresponding Pinecone data connector should be connected.

### Low-code setup

For advanced users who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a Pinecone data connector using the following cURL commands:

1. Create a Pinecone data connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "pinecone",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/data-pinecone",
  "description": "The Pinecone vector database",
  "configuration": {
    "url": <Pinecone host address>,
    "api_key": <api key>
  }
}'
```

2. Connect the connector `pinecone`:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors/pinecone/connect
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Supported operations

The Pinecone connector supports two operations: UPSERT and QUERY.

1. UPSERT - use this to insert a new vector embedding or modify existing ones. It accepts an array of `vectors` as a required parameter. Where each `vector` is an object with an `id` and an array of floating point numbers.

   Ref: https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/upsert

2. QUERY - use this to perform a similarity search on stored vectors. It requires 2 parameters: `topK` - the number of matches to return, and `vector` - the query vector which is an array of floating point numbers.
