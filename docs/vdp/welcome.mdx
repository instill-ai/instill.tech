[**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) is a source available unstructured data infrastructure tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline:

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- **Transform** it into analysable or meaningful data representations by AI models
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

We've made it easy to get started with VDP either through Instill Cloud or self-hosting.

## Highlights

- 🚀 The _fastest_ way to build end-to-end unstructured data pipelines
- ⚡️ High-performing backends implemented in Go
- 🖱️ One-click import & deploy models
- 📦 Standardise AI task output formats for data integration
- 🔌 Pre-built ETL data connectors for extensive data access
- 🪢 Perform in `SYNC` for real-time inference and `ASYNC` for on-demand workload
- 🧁 Scalable API-first microservice design for great developer experience
- 🤠 Built for every AI and Data practitioner with no-/low-code interfaces

## Self-host VDP

VDP is source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp).
Check out the [quick start](/docs/vdp/getting-started) and understand the [core concepts](/docs/vdp/core-concepts/overview).
Then, learn about how to [deploy VDP](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview) in your infrastructure.
