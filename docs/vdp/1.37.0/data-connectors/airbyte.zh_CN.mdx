The Airbyte Data Connectors allow users to leverage the power of Airbyte and its 30+ destination connectors to facilitate data movement and transformation.
VDP implements the [Airbyte Protocol](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol) to enable seamless integration with Airbyte's destination connectors for writing data results.

## Release stage

To check the current release status and supported connectors, please consult the [Airbyte Destinations Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/#destinations) table.

## Configuration

Please refer to each of Airbyte [Destinations](https://docs.airbyte.com/category/destinations) for configuration details.

### No-code setup

To create an Airbyte data connector (e.g., PostgreSQL) effortlessly, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Data** page and click **Set up new data connector**
2. Click the **Data connector type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **Postgres**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Optionally, give a short description in the **Description** field

Now go to the **Data** page, the corresponding PostgresSQL data connector should be connected.

An Airbyte data connector is in `CONNECTED` state only when its configuration is validated. Otherwise, the state will be either `ERROR` or `UNSPECIFIED`.

### Low-code setup

For advanced users who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a PostgreSQL data connector using the following cURL commands:

1. Create a Postgres data connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "postgres-db",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/data-postgres",
  "description": "The PostgreSQL database in your basement",
  "configuration": {
    "host": <PostgreSQL host address>,
    "port": <port>,
    "database": <database>,
    "schema": "public",
    "username": <username>,
    "password": <password>,
    "ssl": false
  }
}'
```

2. Connect the connector `postgres-db`:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors/postgres-db/connect
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Writing data to an Airbyte data connector

To enable Airbyte destination connectors and inject data, VDP utilizes the [AirbyteRecordMessage](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#airbyterecordmessage) JSON object.
This facilitates triggering the container's [`write`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#write) operation for the Airbyte destination connector.

For this purpose, `connector-backend` assembles the [ConfiguredAirbyteCatalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/beginners-guide-to-catalog/#configuredairbytecatalog) on-the-fly,
utilizing the corresponding connector configuration JSON object used in the [`check`](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/airbyte-protocol/#check) operation.
This initiates a Temporal workflow to write the structured data to the destination.

Regarding Airbyte connections and sync modes, VDP currently supports the `full_refresh` sync mode and the `append` destination sync mode.

Please note that VDP does not currently support Airbyte's [Namespaces](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/namespaces).
