The AI connector allows seamless integration of AI models from various sources,
including both first-party ModelOps platform **Instill Model** and third-party model vendors, as well as in-house model serving platforms.

The AI connectors play a crucial role in VDP pipelines to transform unstructured data into meaningful and analysable representations,
making it easier to extract valuable insights.

Here is a list of the supported AI connectors that you can leverage for your projects. You can find detailed information about each connector in the [connector-ai](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-ai) repository:
