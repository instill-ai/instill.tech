The Instill Model Connector enables you to connect the AI models served on the Instill Model Platform for various AI tasks.

## Release stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

The up-to-date configuration is maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-ai/blob/main/pkg/instill/config/seed/definitions.json).

| Field        | Type   | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :----------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api_token    | string | To access models on **Instill Cloud**, enter your Instill Cloud API Token. You can find your tokens by visiting your **Instill Cloud's Settings > API Tokens** page. Leave this field empty to access models on your local Instill Model. |
| server_url\* | string | Base URL for the Instill Model API. To access models on Instill Cloud, use the base URL `https://api-model.instill.tech`. To access models on your local Instill Model, use the base URL `http://localhost:9080`.                         |
| model_id\*   | string | ID of the Instill Model model to be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### No-code setup

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  
Comparing to launching a local Instill Model, **Instill Cloud** is the fastest way to create an Instill Model AI Connector.
  
ðŸ‘‰ You can try out [Instill Cloud](https://console.instill.tech) to use our pre-created Instill Model AI connector for FREE during Open Alpha.

</InfoBlock>

To create an Instill Model AI connector from [Instill Cloud](https://console.instill.tech),
you'll first need to create an Instill Cloud account by visiting [console.instill.tech](https://console.instill.tech).

1. Visit [Model Hub](https://console.instill.tech/model-hub) on Instill Cloud to explore available models
2. Go to the **AI** page of your [local Console](http://localhost:3000) and click **Set up new AI**
3. In the **Set Up New AI Connector** page, fill an ID for your model, this will be the unique identifier of this connector
4. [Optional] Give a short description of your connector in the **Description** field
5. Click the **AI Connector Type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **Instill Model**
6. Fill in the following information and click **Set up**

   - Enter **API Key**. You can find your Instill Cloud API tokens by visiting your [**Settings**](https://console.instill.tech/settings) > **API Tokens** page.
   - Set the the Server URL https://api-model.instill.tech to access models on Instill Cloud
   - Enter the ID of the model from Model Hub on Instill Cloud that you want to use

7. By default, the connector is disconnected. To connect and use AI connector, go to the connector page and click **Connect**.

To create an Instill Model AI connector from local Instill Model, follow the same steps, follow the same steps as above, but with the following difference in step 1 and 6:

1. Visit local Instill Model from local Console](http://localhost:3000/model-hub) to create and deploy your models

and

5. Fill the following information and click **Set up**

   - Leave the **API Key** field empty to access models on your local Instill Model
   - Set the Server URL to http://localhost:9080 to access models on your local Instill Model.
   - Enter the ID of the model served on your local Instill Model that you want to use

### Low-code setup

1. Create an Instill Model AI connector from Instill Cloud

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "my-instill-model",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/ai-instill-model",
  "configuration": {
    "api_token": "<instill-cloud-api-token>",
    "server_url": "https://api-model.instill.tech",
    "model_id": "yolov7"
  }
}'
```

Or create an Instill Model AI connector from local Instill Model

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "my-instill-model",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/ai-instill-model",
  "configuration": {
    "api_token": "",
    "server_url": "http://localhost:9080",
    "model_id": "<id-of-the-model-served-on-your-local-instill-model>"
  }
}'
```

2. Connect the connector `my-instill-model`

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors/my-instill-model/connect
```
