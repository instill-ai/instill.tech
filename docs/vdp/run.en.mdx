**ðŸ’§ Instill VDP** allows you to run your pipelines either in the **Pipeline
Editor** page, in the **Pipeline Preview** page, or via an API endpoint.

## Run in the Pipeline Preview Page

Proceed to a pipeline card on the **Pipelines** page in the console:

1. Provide the necessary data or upload files as inputs.
2. Click the `Run` button to run the pipeline and receive the results.

## Run in the Pipeline Editor Page

To activate your pipeline, adhere to these instructions:

1. Press the **Save** button located at the top-right corner of the **Pipeline Editor** page to preserve your progress.
2. Provide the necessary data or upload files as inputs.
3. Click the `Run` button to run the pipeline and receive the results.

## Run via API Endpoint

Running a pipeline via API endpoint in **ðŸ’§ Instill VDP** is straightforward. You can find the
cURL snippet in **Pipeline Editor** > **Toolkit** > **Trigger Snippet** tab.

### Steps to Run Pipeline

1. Navigate to the **Pipeline Editor** interface:

   - Proceed to the **Toolkit** > **Trigger Snippet** tab to locate the cURL
     snippet.

2. Set up the API Request:

   - Confirm that you have the correct API endpoint, `USER_ID`, `PIPELINE_ID`,
     and `API_TOKEN`.
   - Arrange the data payload with the necessary fields.

3. Send the API Request:
   - Utilize the supplied cURL command to send a POST request to the API
     endpoint.
   - Check the response to confirm the successful run of the pipeline.

Please make sure to correctly configure the required values:

- **Authentication**: Verify that your `API_TOKEN` is valid and possesses the
  required permissions to activate the pipeline. The API Token can be generated
  in **Settings** > **API Token**.
- **Data Formatting**: Comply with the standard JSON format as outlined in the
  API document.

By adhering to these instructions, you can incorporate the pipeline
run into your existing data workflows.

### Example API Request

Please consult the [Introduction](../vdp/introduction) for guidance on setting
up the pipeline recipe. For example, if your pipeline specifies an input
variable `prompt` and an output `answer`, the corresponding API request command
would be:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/v1beta/users/USER_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN' \
--data '{
  "data": [
    {
      "variable": {
        "prompt": "hello world"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

This command sends a POST request to run the pipeline, with the variable
`prompt` set to "hello world".

### Corresponding Response

The corresponding response for the above API request will be:

```json
{
  "output": [
    {
      "answer": "Hello user"
    }
  ]
}
```
