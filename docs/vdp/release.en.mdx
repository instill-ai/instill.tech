You can gain increased flexibility and control with Version Control, which lets you track changes in your pipelines and apps over time. This feature allows users to utilize different versions of the same pipeline for backup, recovery, A/B testing, and more.

Follow these steps:

1. Click `Release` in the top-right corner.
2. Choose a versioning format based on semantic principles.
3. Add a description (optional).
4. To view previous versions, click on `Releases` and choose older version in the bottom-left corner.
