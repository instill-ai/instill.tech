## Description

- An Airbyte destination connector paired with any source connector defines an `ASYNC` or `PULL` pipeline.
- An Airbyte destination connector is in `CONNECTED` state only when its configuration is valid to connect with the destination. Otherwise, the state will be either `ERROR` or `UNSPECIFIED`.

## Release stage

Please refer to the Airbyte [Destinations Connector Catalog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/#destinations) table.

## Configuration

Please refer to each of Airbyte [Destinations](https://docs.airbyte.com/category/destinations) for configuration details.

## No-code setup

To create an Airbyte destination connector (e.g., PostgreSQL):

1. Go to the **Destination** page and click **Set up new destination**
2. Click the **Destination type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **Postgres**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. [Optional] Give a short description in the **Description** field

Now go to the **Destination** page, the corresponding PostgresSQL destination connector should be connected.

## Low-code setup

To create a Postgres destination connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "postgres-db",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/destination-postgres",
  "description": "The PostgreSQL database in your basement",
  "configuration": {
    "host": <PostgreSQL host address>,
    "port": <port>,
    "database": <database>,
    "schema": "public",
    "username": <username>,
    "password": <password>,
    "ssl": false
  }
}'
```
