A destination connector is to write the data with standardised connector format to the destination data warehouse or notification.

Currently, VDP supports destination connectors:

- [HTTP](/docs/vdp/destination-connectors/http)
- [gRPC](/docs/vdp/destination-connectors/grpc)
- [Airbyte Destination Connectors](/docs/vdp/destination-connectors/airbyte)

If you'd like to **ask for a new destination connector**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions), or request it in the **#vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
