The purpose of Instill Credit is easing the adoption of Instill Cloud, minimizing the time required to build and set up a pipeline.
After setting up your account, you'll get **10,000 monthly credits for free**, which can be spent on the following actions:

- Trigger your own pipelines, or any public pipeline available on Instill Hub.
- Execute pre-configured **AI** components without needing to create accounts or API keys on 3rd party services.

## Pipeline triggers

Each pipeline trigger will consume **1 credit per component** within the pipeline.

This excludes the **trigger** and **response** components which don't consume any credit, as they are the pipeline's input and output interfaces.

## AI components

Additionally, Instill AI facilitates out-of-the-box configuration for certain AI components.
When such components are created, if the selected task and model are supported, the default configuration will contain the credentials to start using the component.

If you want to override the default configuration and bring your own key, you can update the **Connection** configuration in your component.
Connection fields only take references to secrets in order to minimize the risk of leaking credentials when sharing your pipelines.
Therefore, you'll need to create a secret with your API key in your account settings page.

To go back to using the Instill credentials on your component, you can reference the `${secrets.INSTILL_SECRET}` in the component configuration.
You may use this reference as well if you want to modify an existing pipeline (e.g. one you cloned from Instill Hub) and use the default credentials on any supported component.

The following section details the supported AI tasks & models and their Instill Credit cost per unit.

#### Next additions

Check our [Roadmap](../roadmap) and subscribe to our [Newsletter](/newsletter/?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=link) to keep up to date with the latest tasks, models and vendors that are supported by Instill Credit.

We also plan to leverage Instill Credit to ease data storage and model hosting, stay tuned!

## How can I get more credit?

Initially, users will get **10,000 free credits every month**.
Soon, different pricing plans will include higher amounts of monthly Instill Credit.

Our roadmap includes features to cover the cases when the monthly Instill Credit isn't enough:

- **Credit purchase**, for users that exhausted their Credit before the end of the month.
- **Credit auto-billing**, which will top-up Credit before it is exhausted, keeping production environment from any potential downtime.
