## About the Project

**üíß Instill VDP** (Versatile Data Pipeline) is a powerful tool designed to build
end-to-end unstructured data pipelines. It leverages the capabilities of
3rd-party data, AI, and applications functionalities and seamlessly connect with
**‚öóÔ∏è [Instill Model](/docs/model/introduction)** and **üíæ [Instill
Artifact](/docs/artifact/introduction)** via **‚öôÔ∏è [Instill
Component](/docs/component/introduction)** components.

## Pipeline Recipe

A pipeline is defined by a `recipe`, which is essentially a JSON object composed
of a run method, variable, output and multiple components:

Here is a sample recipe where the input is a `prompt`, and the output is a
`text`.

```json
{
  "on": {},
  "variable": {
    "prompt": {
      "title": "input",
      "instillFormat": "string"
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "title": "text",
      "value": "${op-0.output.texts[0]}"
    }
  },
  "component": {
    "op-0": {
      "type": "openai",
      "task": "TASK_TEXT_GENERATION",
      "input": {
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "n": 2,
        "prompt": "${variable.prompt}",
        "response_format": {
          "type": "text"
        },
        "system_message": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "temperature": 1,
        "top_p": 1
      },
      "setup": {
        "api_key": "${secret.my-openai-key}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Within the recipe, we have four essential fields, `on`, `variable`, `output` and
`component`.

### On

Indicates how the pipeline is run.

#### Run on Request

VDP supports running a pipeline via HTTP and gRPC protocols in `SYNC` or `ASYNC`
mode. The user doesn't need to set up the configuration in the `on` field. Every
pipeline can run if the user provides `variable` in the request.

- **SYNC Mode**: Responds to a request synchronously, sending back the result to
  the user immediately after the data is processed. This mode is suitable for
  real-time inference scenarios where low latency is crucial.

- **ASYNC Mode**: Performs asynchronous workload. The user runs the pipeline
  with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledgment response.
  This mode is ideal for use cases that require long-running workloads.

Please refer to [Run a pipeline](../vdp/run) for more details.

#### Run on Scheduler (Coming Soon)

A pipeline run by a scheduler performs scheduled workloads to regularly run the
pipeline.

#### Run on Event (Coming Soon)

A pipeline run by a Pub-Sub or Message Queue service.

#### Run on Application (Coming Soon)

A pipeline run by an application event.

### Variable

Set up the variables of the pipeline so every component can reference the data
from the variables:

- **`title`**: The title of the variable, which can be displayed on the Console.
- **`description`**: A description of the variable, which can be displayed on
  the Console.
- **`instillFormat`**: The instill format of the variable. Users can use this to
  control the data format. Please refer to [`Instill
Format`](../vdp/instill-format) for more details.

### Output

Set up ths output of the pipeline:

- **`title`**: The title of the output, which can be displayed on the Console.
- **`description`**: A description of the output, which can be displayed on the
  Console.
- **`value`**: The value of the output, which can be referenced from any
  component data.

### Component

Consists of multiple components, which can be a generic, AI, data, application,
or operator component.

- Each component must have a unique component ID, e.g., `openai-0`. This
  component ID should follow the [RFC1034
  rule](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034), which consists of
  alphabets, numbers, and hyphens.
- For a `AI`, `data`, `application` or `operator`, we need to set up these
  fields:
  - **type**: Indicates which type of component it is.
  - **task**: Indicates which task of the component. The task will be listed in
    the component definition `tasks` field.
    [Example](https://api.instill.tech/vdp/v1beta/component-definitions/openai?view=VIEW_FULL).
  - **input**: Sets up the input data. The schema is described in the
    `spec.component_specification` field.
  - **setup**: Sets up how the component is setup, e.g. setup a `api_key` for
    the connection. The schema is described in the
    `spec.component_specification` field.
  - **condition**: (optional) Sets up the condition for whether this component
    will be executed or not.
- For a `generic.iterator`, we need to set up these fields:
  - **input**: The array input.
  - **outputElements**: Sets up the output of this iterator.
  - **component**: An array of components that are executed inside the iterator.

## Data Flow

### Reference from Data

Within pipeline components, we use a **reference** syntax to set up the data
flow, i.e., the **input** field of each component:

- A Reference employs special syntax enclosed in single curly brackets. For
  example,
  - Reference data from the pipeline variable: `${variable.KEY}`, you can add
    any fields you want in the `recipe.variable`.
  - Reference data from the component: `${comp-id.input.KEY}` or
    `${comp-id.output.KEY}`, the available data fields are described in
    `component_specification` of each component.
- It functions as a variable reference, copying the value from an upstream
  component to the data input while preserving the original data type.

When run by request, we also need to set up the response data of the request.
You can add any fields you want in the `recipe.output`.

If you don't want to use data reference, you can also set up the constant value
in the recipe.

When utilizing batch running in VDP, where each component processes an array of
inputs, the rendered data input for this component, with batch 2 as an example,
appears as follows:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "prompt": "What is Instill AI building?"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What is Instill Core?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Please refer to the [API
document](https://openapi.instill.tech/reference/pipelinepublicservice_triggeruserpipeline)
for instructions on how to run a pipeline.

### Reference from Secrets

Besides reference data from the pipeline input or component setting, we can also
reference secrets from the secret management system. The value of these secrets
fields will be kept out of the recipe. So when the pipeline is shared or
published, the keys will always be protected. Examples: `"api_key":
"${secrets.my-openai-key}"`. Please refer to [Secret Management](../vdp/secret)
for more details.

## Control Flow

Within pipeline components, control flow is facilitated through setting
**condition** in each component, which serves as the means to specify the
condition determining whether this component will be executed or not.

**Example Configuration**

Let's begin with an example.

```json
{
  "condition": "${variable.a-condition-str} == \"TARGET_CONDITION_STR\""
}
```

This `condition` field allows us to define the condition setting. The VDP will
interpret and use this configuration to decide whether this component will be
executed or not. We have two types of conditions: "condition on value" and
"condition on status".

### Condition on Value

We support the following syntax for the condition:

- Logic
  - `&&`
  - `||`
- Comparison
  - `<`
  - `>`
  - `<=`
  - `>=`
  - `==`
  - `!=`
- Not
  - `!`
- Parentheses
  - `()`

**Examples:**

Here are some examples for the condition field:

- Condition on string value

  ```json
  {
    "condition": "${variable.a-condition-str} == \"TARGET_CONDITION_STR\""
  }
  ```

- Condition on number value

  ```json
  {
    "condition": "${variable.a-condition-num} > 1"
  }
  ```

- Condition on boolean value

  ```json
  {
    "condition": "${variable.a-condition-bool}"
  }
  ```

- Complex condition

  ```json
  {
    "condition": "(${variable.a-condition-bool} && ${comp-a.output.x} == 1) || ${comp-b.output.y} < 1"
  }
  ```

- Always false
  ```json
  {
    "condition": "false"
  }
  ```

### Condition on Status

Besides "condition on value," we also support the condition on status. We
provide a boolean value called `status.completed`, which allows you to condition
on whether a component's execution is completed or not.

**Examples:**

Here are some examples for the condition field:

- The component will be executed after component `compA` is completed; you can
  use this to control the execution order of components.

  ```json
  {
    "condition": "${comp-a.status.completed}"
  }
  ```

- You can also combine it with the value condition.
  ```json
  {
    "condition": "${variable.a-condition-bool} || ${comp-a.status.completed}"
  }
  ```
