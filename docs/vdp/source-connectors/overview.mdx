The source connector is in charge of ingesting unstructured data into a pipeline.

Currently, VDP supports the following connectors:

- [HTTP](/docs/vdp/source-connectors/http)
- [gRPC](/docs/vdp/source-connectors/grpc)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new source connector**, you can create a topic in [Discussions](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions), or request it in the **#vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
