## Description

- When a HTTP source connector is paired with a HTTP destination connector, the pipeline will be in the `SYNC` mode.
- When a HTTP source connector is paired with an Airbyte connector, the pipeline will be in the `ASYNC` mode.
- An HTTP source connector cannot be paired with a gRPC destination connector.
- A HTTP source connector is always in the `CONNECTED` state.
- A HTTP source connector's ID must be `source-http`
- A user account can set up only one HTTP source connector.

## Release stage

`Generally Available`

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Note                                                                                                  |
| :---- | :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A   | N/A  | This connector doesn't take any configuration so the configuration field is an empty JSON object `{}` |

### No-code setup

To create a HTTP source connector:

1. Go to the **Source** page and click **Set up new source**
2. Click the **Source type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **HTTP**

Now go to the **Source** page, the corresponding HTTP source connector should be connected.

### Low-code setup

To create a HTTP source connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "source-http",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/source-http",
  "configuration": {}
}'
```
