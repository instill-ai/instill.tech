To facilitate more flexible and fine-grained data injection and manipulation, **Operators** allow users to run data manipulation without the need for server management or pre-provisioning.

Currently, VDP supports the following operators:

- [**Start**](start)
- [**End**](end)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

If you'd like to **ask for a new operator**, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/instill-ai/community/issues) or request it in the **#instill-vdp** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).
