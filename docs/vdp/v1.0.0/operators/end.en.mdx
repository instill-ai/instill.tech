An [**End**](end) operator is to control the data received as a response when a pipeline trigger via SYNC API.

## Release stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Note                                                                                                 |
| :---- | :--- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A   | N/A  | This operator doesn't take any configuration so the configuration field is an empty JSON object `{}` |

### No-code setup

To create an End operator:

1. Go to the **Operator** page and click **Set up new operator**
2. Click the **Operator type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **End**

Now go to the **Operator** page, the corresponding operator with ID `end` should be connected.

### Low-code setup

To create an End operator:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/operators -d '{
  "id": "end",
  "operator_definition_name": "operator-definitions/end",
  "configuration": {}
}'
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).
