The BigQuery Data Connector allows users to insert data to BigQuery tables.

## Configuration

Latest configuration is maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-data/blob/main/pkg/bigquery/config/definitions.json)

There are four things needed to configure a BigQuery connector: Project ID, Dataset ID, Table Name and JSON Key (for auth).
To get these details, visit https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery and navigate to your project and then dataset.

### No-code setup

To create a BigQuery data connector effortlessly, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Data** page and click **Set up new data connector**
2. Click the **Data connector type** â–¾ drop-down and choose **BigQuery**
3. Fill in the required fields
4. Optionally, give a short description in the **Description** field

Now go to the **Data** page, the corresponding BigQuery data connector should be connected.

### Low-code setup

For advanced users who prefer a more hands-on approach, you can create a BigQuery data connector using the following cURL commands:

1. Create a BigQuery data connector:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors -d '{
  "id": "bigquery",
  "connector_definition_name": "connector-definitions/data-bigquery",
  "description": "BigQuery connector",
  "configuration": {
    "json_key": "<JSON key file contents here>"
    "project_id": "<project id>",
    "dataset_id": "<dataset id>",
    "table_name": "<table name>"
  }
}'
```

2. Connect the connector `pinecone`:

```shellscript cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/connectors/pinecone/connect
```

For other operations, please refer to the [VDP Protobufs](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).

## Supported operations

The BigQuery connector supports these operations: INSERT

1. INSERT - use this to insert a new record to BigQuery. It accepts an object of key-value pair which is in accordance with your table schema. For example, if your table schema contains the following fields - id INT, name STRING. The object should look something like - 
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Name here"
}
```
