Welcome to the documentation for [**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp),
an unstructured data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool designed to streamline end-to-end data processing pipelines.
VDP serves as a powerful backbone for building AI-first applications.

VDP allows you to perform the following key functions:

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as AI applications, cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices
- **Transform** unstructured data into analysable or meaningful data representations using AI models
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations

Whether you're working on a proof of concept or a full-fledged production application, VDP makes it easy to get started.
You can deploy it using [Instill Cloud](/docs/cloud/getting-started) or [host it yourself](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview).

## Highlights

- 🚀 Accelerate AI-first applications by building end-to-end AI-powered pipelines for unstructured data up to 10 times faster
- 🔌 Utilize pre-built connectors to access data from various sources, powerful AI models, and third-party tools
- 🌟 Benefit from a no-code drag-and-drop pipeline builder, enabling quick and customizable application development
- 🪢 Choose between real-time inference (SYNC) and on-demand workload (ASYNC) processing modes
- 🧁 Enjoy a scalable API-first microservice design, offering an excellent developer experience
- ⚡️ Leverage high-performing backends implemented in Go
- 📊 Gain visibility into pipeline performance through a detailed dashboard
- 🤠 Access no-/low-code interfaces, making VDP suitable for every AI and data practitioner

## Getting started

To begin using VDP, you have two options:

- **Self-Host VDP**: VDP is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp). Follow the [quick start](/docs/vdp/getting-started) guide to get up and running. Make sure to understand the [core concepts](/docs/vdp/core-concepts/overview) before [deploying VDP](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview) in your infrastructure
- **Instill Cloud**: If you prefer a managed service, you can use [Instill Cloud](/docs/cloud/getting-started) to set up and work with VDP effortlessly.
