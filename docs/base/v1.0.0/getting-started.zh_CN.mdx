**Instill Base** runs the essential services required for accessing the complete functionality of Instill Core.
For detailed information on Instill VDP and Model deployment, kindly refer to the respective deployment documentation:

- [Instill VDP Deployment](/docs/vdp/deployment/overview)
- [Instill Model Deployment](/docs/model/deployment/overview)

We've made it easy to get started with Instill Base either on a local machine.

## Local run

<InfoBlock type="warning" title="WARNING">
  The code in the `main` branch reflects ongoing development progress for the
  next release and may not work as expected. If you need a stable alpha version,
  use the [latest release](https://github.com/instill-ai/base/releases) instead.
</InfoBlock>

Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - Instill Base works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows at the moment.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - Instill Base uses Docker Compose to run all services at local.

Get started locally by running:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/base.git && cd base
make all
```

Once the services are up, the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To shut down all running services:

```shellscript
make down
```
