**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)** is an open-source unstructured data Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Before we start, let's briefly introduce "Why we need VDP?"


## What is ETL

When people say they are data-driven, most of the time, it means structured data drive them. Although [80% of the world's data are unstructured](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/the-future-of-data-revolution-will-be-unstructured-data/), the reality is that unstructured data are more challenging to analyse. It requires Iterative ETL procedures (sometimes called data massage) to convert this unstructured data into its structured format ready for further analysis.

VDP streamlines the end-to-end unstructured Data processing pipeline: 

- **Extract** unstructured data (e.g., images) from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage or IoT devices.
- **Transform** it into analysable data representations (e.g., labels) with AI models.
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations.

## Why VDP?

Due to the proliferation of AI, more and more developers and companies wish to include AI models in their ETL pipelines. Unfortunately, building reliable ETL pipelines can be challenging. Not many companies know or have the resources to deal with it. That's why we introduce [Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)](http://go.instill.tech/4em2l4), **a general and modularised ETL infrastructure powered by AI for unstructured data**.

Developers won't need to build their data connectors, AI model serving platform (requiring much maintenance), and ELT-pipeline automation tools.*

## Highlights

You don't need to know these when using VDP. But we are proud to say VDP is:

-   🚀 The _fastest_ way to build end-to-end unstructured data pipelines
-   ⚡️ High-performing backends implemented in Go
-   🖱️ One-click import & deploy models
-   📦 Standardise AI task output formats for data integration
-   🔌 Pre-built ETL data connectors for extensive data access
-   🪢 Perform in `SYNC` for real-time inference and `ASYNC` for on-demand workload
-   🧁 Scalable API-first microservice design for great developer experience
-   🤠 Built for every AI and Data practitioner with no-/low-code interfaces
