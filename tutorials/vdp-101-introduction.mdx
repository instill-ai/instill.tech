**Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)** is an open-source unstructured data Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool to streamline the end-to-end unstructured data processing pipeline with Machline Leaning (ML). Before we start, let's have a brief introducion of "Why we need VDP?"


## What is ETL

When people say they are data-driven, most of the time it means they are driven by structured data. Although [80% of the world's data are unstructured](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/the-future-of-data-revolution-will-be-unstructured-data/), the reality is that unstructured data are more difficult to analyse. It requires Iterative ETL procedures (or some times called data massage) to convert this unstructured data into its structured format ready for further analysis.

- **Extract** unstructured data from pre-built data sources such as cloud/on-prem storage, or IoT devices.
- **Transform** it into analysable or meaningful data representations by AI models.
- **Load** the transformed data into warehouses, applications, or other destinations.

# Why VDP?

Due to the proflieration of ML and AI, more and more developers and companies wish to include ML models in their ETL pipelines. Unfortuenatly, building a reliable ETL pipeline supporting ML/AI is not easy. Not a lot of companies know or have the resources to deal with it. That's why, we introduce [Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)](http://go.instill.tech/4em2l4), **a general and modularised ETL infrastructure powered by ML for unstructured data**.

> *We believe **VDP** is the future Machline Learning ETL for **unstructured data**. Developers won't need to build their own data connectors, ML model serving platform (requiring a lot of maintenance ) and ELT-pipeline automation tools.*

# Highlights

You don't need to to know these when using VDP. But we are pround to say VDP is:

-   🚀 The _fastest_ way to build end-to-end unstructured data pipelines
-   ⚡️ High-performing backends implemented in Go
-   🖱️ One-click import & deploy models
-   📦 Standardise AI task output formats for data integration
-   🔌 Pre-built ETL data connectors for extensive data access
-   🪢 Perform in `SYNC` for real-time inference and `ASYNC` for on-demand workload
-   🧁 Scalable API-first microservice design for great developer experience
-   🤠 Built for every AI and Data practitioner with no-/low-code interfaces

Okay, now you know what is VDP. Let's deploy VDP on your machine! [VDP 101 - Installation]
