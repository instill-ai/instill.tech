In the previous tutorial [VDP 101 [4/7] How to trigger a SYNC pipeline?](/tutorials/vdp-101-4-how-to-trigger-a-sync-pipeline), you have learned how to trigger and send data to the pipeline. However, we haven't talked about how to process it.
In the `SYNC` mode, VDP returns the triggering pipeline results according to the protocol (i.e., `HTTP/gRPC`) used for triggering the pipeline. In this tutorial, we will use the HTTP protocol as an example to demonstrate how to parse the responses from a `SYNC` pipeline.

## How to process pipeline responses

Let's go back to our code in `sync-http-base64.py`. After triggering a `SYNC` pipeline, the function will return a response from your triggered pipeline.

```python
# Post HTTP request to the SYNC pipeline
resp = trigger_pipeline_base64(api_gateway_url, opt.pipeline_id, img_string)

# Parse results from the SYNC pipeline
boxes_ltwh, categories, scores = parse_detection_response(resp)
```

Here, the pipeline responds to our HTTP POST request with `resp: request.Response`, which is then passed to a user-defined parser `parse_detection_response(resp)` to extract object detection results.
In the parser, you extract data structs from the standardised response for easy access using the one-line code below.

```python
# Parse JSON into an object with attributes corresponding to dict keys.
r = json.loads(resp.text, object_hook=lambda d: SimpleNamespace(**d))
```

## Pipeline response in `SYNC` mode

<CH.Scrollycoding>
To better understand what is in the `resp`, let's have a closer look at `resp.text`, the content of the `SYNC` mode response in JSON format:

```python
## This is the object returned in SYNC mode.
{
   "data_mapping_indices":[
      "01GPXG4P8MWZD4ZQMXD98CAEGG"
   ],
   "model_outputs":[
      {
         "model":"models/yolov7",
         "task":"TASK_DETECTION",
         "task_outputs":[
            {
               "index":"01GPXG4P8MWZD4ZQMXD98CAEGG",
               "detection":{
                  "objects":[
                     {
                        "category":"dog",
                        "score":0.9601877,
                        "bounding_box":{
                           "top":102,
                           "left":324,
                           "width":208,
                           "height":405
                        }
                     },
                     {
                        "category":"dog",
                        "score":0.9304089,
                        "bounding_box":{
                           "top":198,
                           "left":130,
                           "width":198,
                           "height":237
                        }
                     }
                  ]
               }
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

`data_mapping_indices`: is the pipeline trigger operation ID. You probably don't need the IDs in the `SYNC` mode, as you receive responses right after you trigger pipelines.
However, in the `ASYNC` and `PULL` modes, where pipelines do not return with model inference results immediately, users need the IDs to locate corresponding results in the destination (e.g., database).

```shellscript focus=3:5

```

---

`model_outputs`: is a list of outputs generated by triggering a pipeline with a batch of data.
Taking object detection as an example, if you pass **N** images to the pipeline, it will return a list consisting of **N** outputs.

```shellscript focus=6:7

```

---

`model` is the model component you used when creating the pipeline.

```shellscript focus=8:8

```

---

`task` indicates the AI task the model designed to solve. Please read the following section about [what AI tasks are supported by VDP](#ai-tasks-supported-by-vdp).
Note that when [importing a model](/docs/latest/import-models/overview/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-5-how-to-parse-vdp-responses), users need to [specify the corresponding AI task in the model card](/docs/latest/prepare-models/model-card/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-5-how-to-parse-vdp-responses).

```shellscript focus=9:9

```

---

`task_outputs`: is a list of corresponding task outputs given the input data.

```shellscript focus=10:11

```

---

`index`: is the same as the `data_mapping_indices` received when triggering pipelines. Users can use it to match trigger queries and task outputs.

```shellscript focus=12:12

```

---

`detection`: indicates the Object Detection task outputs: a list of detection `objects`. Read more about the task [here](/docs/latest/core-concepts/ai-task#object-detection)

```shellscript focus=13:35

```

## AI tasks supported by VDP

In addition to Object Detection, Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP) supports extensive AI tasks. A complete list can be found in the [Standardise AI tasks documentation](/docs/latest/core-concepts/ai-task?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-5-how-to-parse-vdp-responses).

- **Image Classification** - classify images into predefined categories
- **Object Detection** - detect and localise multiple objects in images
- **Keypoint Detection** - detect and localise multiple keypoints of objects in images
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** - detect and recognise text in images
- **Instance Segmentation** - detect, localise and delineate multiple objects in images
- **Semantic Segmentation** - classify image pixels into predefined categories
- **Text to Image** - generate images from input text prompts
- **Text Generation** - generate texts from input text prompts
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±

For each supported AI task, we define the standard input and output formats maintained via [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/tree/main/vdp/model/v1alpha). By standardising the data format of model outputs into AI tasks, model in a pipeline is modularized: you can freely switch to use different models in a pipeline as long as the model is designed for the same task.
Also, VDP produces a stream of data from models with standard format for use in a data integration or ETL pipeline. That also enables us writing a corresponding parser for the Object Detection task in this tutorial.

## What's next?

We have demonstrated how to use VDP step-by-step in `SYNC` mode. However, VDP supports other modes, including `ASYNC` and `PULL`. Before showing how they work, let's closely look at their differences in our following tutorial â†’ [VDP 101 [6/7] Pipeline Modes: SYNC, ASYNC, and PULL](/tutorials/vdp-101-6-pipeline-modes).
