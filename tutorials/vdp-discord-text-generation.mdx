Text generation is one of the most popular AI tasks at the moment. The goal of Text Generation is to generate paragraphs of text that is indistinguishable to human-written text.
In this tutorial, we will build a Text Generator Discord app that takes text a user provides as input and automatically fill in what it thinks comes next.
Under the hood, the app is powered by triggering a VDP pipeline with state-of-the-art Text Generation models.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **A machine with GPUs** - To run the GPT model in this tutorial, you will needs a local machine with GPUs.
- **Versatile Data Pipeline (VDP)** - VDP works on macOS or Linux. See [VDP 101[2/7] Launch VDP on your local machine](/tutorials/vdp-101-2-quickstart) for installation instructions.
- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** - To enable support in VDP, please refer to [NVIDIA Cloud Native Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) to install NVIDIA Container Toolkit. If you'd like to specifically allot GPUs to VDP, you can set the environment variable [NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/user-guide.html#gpu-enumeration) in the VDP [.env](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/.env) file.
- **NodeJS** - The Discord app is built with [discord-interation](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js), an npm package based on Javacsript. See [download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for installation instructions.

## Build Text Generation pipelines

Text Generation tasks focus on generating text according to user text inputs. State-of-the-art models are typically gigantic.
For example, [GPT3.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), the backbone of ChatGPT, consists of 175 billion parameters, which is almost impossible to run on a standalone desktop or laptop.
Therefore, we use [Megatron GPT-2 Medium (345m)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) as an example to showcase in this tutorial.

### Build via no-code console

To build a `SYNC` pipeline that supports Discord apps with GTP-2, please follow [VDP 101 [3/7] Create your first pipeline on VDP](/tutorials/vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline) with a few alterations:

1. add an HTTP source,
2. import the **Metatron GPT-2 Medium model (345m)** model from the GitHub repository [`instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc`](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc) with ID `gpt2`,
3. deploy a model instance that is compatible with GPUs on your machine,
4. add an HTTP destination, and
5. set up a pipeline with ID `gpt2`.

:::info{type=info}
Depending on your internet speed, importing [Megatron GPT2 Medium model (345m)](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc) will take a while.

The model only supports GPU deployment. By default, VDP can access all your GPUs. Assume that you have N GPUs, please pick the corresponding model instance tagged with fp32-345m-N-gpu to deploy.
:::

### Build via low-code

In addition to the no-code console, you can also build the pipeline via REST API.

:::info{type=info}
VDP is implemented with [API-first](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core-concepts/overview?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) design principle. It enables seamless integration to your data stack at any scale.
:::

<CH.Scrollycoding>

Programmatically build a `SYNC` pipeline via REST API:

```shellscript

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/source-connectors -d '{
    "id": "source-http",
    "source_connector_definition": "source-connector-definitions/source-http",
    "connector": {
        "configuration": {}
    }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/models -d '{
  "id": "gpt2",
  "model_definition": "model-definitions/github",
  "configuration": {
    "repository": "instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc"
  }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/models/yolov7/instances/fp32-345m-2-gpu/deploy

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/destination-connectors -d '{
  "id": "destination-http",
  "destination_connector_definition": "destination-connector-definitions/destination-http",
  "connector": {
      "configuration": {}
  }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/pipelines -d '{
  "id": "gpt2",
  "recipe": {
    "source": "source-connectors/source-http",
    "model_instances": [
      "models/gpt2/instances/fp32-345m-2-gpu"
    ],
    "destination": "destination-connectors/destination-http"
  }
}'

```

---

**Step 1**:

Add an HTTP data source

```shellscript focus=1:8

```

---

**Step 2**:

Import a model from the GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-gpt2-megatron-dvc) with ID `gpt2`

```shellscript focus=10:16

```

---

**Step 3**:

Deploy a model instance of the imported model. Please choose the one that is compatible with your machine. We use `fp32-345m-2-gpu` as an example here.

```shellscript focus=18:18

```

---

**Step 4**:

Add an HTTP data destination

```shellscript focus=20:26

```

---

**Step 5**:

Set up a pipeline with ID `gpt2`

```shellscript focus=27:38

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

Now you should see a pipeline called `gpt2` in the console. You can trigger the pipeline using the cURL command at the bottom of the page.

## Build the Discord app

Discord app is a versatile tool for developers to create interactive interfaces triggering VDP pipelines within Discord channels. Before building the app, you need to

1. install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and,
2. [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app) with proper permissions:
   - `applications.commands`
   - `bot` (with `Send Messages` and `Use Slash Commands`enabled)

See [Adding scopes and permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started#adding-scopes-and-permissions) for detailed instructions.

### Set up your project

We built this tutorial using a customised discord app. Clone the GitHub project with the shell command below:

```shellscript
# clone vdp-discord-demo repository to local
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp-discord-demo && cd vdp-discord-demo
# install NODEJS depensencies
npm install
```

Before running the Discord app, you must set up a few variables in `vdp.js`. These variables indicate your VDP service and the Text Generation pipeline to trigger.

```javascript
// VDP Text Generation pipeline ID
const pipelineID = "gpt2";

// Set up vdp service endpoint
const vdpConsole = `http://localhost:3000/pipelines/${pipelineID}`;
const triggerPipelineEndpoint = `http://locallhost:8080/${pipelineID}/trigger`;
```

### Get app credentials

To connect the service with your Discord app, fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a .env file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), server ID (`GUILD_ID`), bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

Most of the information can be found in your application listed on the [Developer Portal/Application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Fetching credentials is also covered in detail in [Discord Getting Started](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

- `APP_ID`: under Developer Portal/Application/General Information.
- `PUBLIC_KEY`: under Developer Portal/Application/General Information.
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: under Developer Portal/Application/Bot.
- `GUILD_ID` in Discord, right-click on the server you wish to connect to the Discord app and select **Copy ID**.

:::info{type=warning}
These credentials are added in `.env` for local development. Please keep them safe!

### Run the Discord app

After your credentials are set, go ahead and run it:

```shellscript
# run the app
node app.js
```

### Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests. In this tutorial, we use [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic. Use the command below to install or follow the [installation guide](https://ngrok.com/download).

<CH.Code>

```bash macOS
# install ngrok locally on macOS
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

```bash Linux
# install ngrok locally on Linux
snap install ngrok
```

</CH.Code>

Once installed, run **ngork** service with the shell command below:

```bash
# run ngrok using HTTP port 3069
ngrok http 3069
```

And you should see an active ngrok session:

```bash
ngrok                                                                                                                                                    (Ctrl+C to quit)

```

:::info{type=info}
Free version **ngrok** can only be active for two hours. Ensure you update the endpoint setting under the **General information** page. Otherwise, you can consider hosting your server or using online services such as [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Please see [Running your app on Discord](https://glitch.com/) for further details.
:::

Finally, go to your application under the **Discord Developer Portal**, copy the endpoint address, the **forwarding address** provided by **ngrok**, and paste it in the `INTERACTION ENDPOINT URL` below the **PUBLIC KEY** in the General Information page.

You should now see a Discord bot being added to your Discord server as a user! Your bot is now a user who can access your Discord channels with default permissions. You can update its access permission by assigning a role or setting up channel permissions. Please read [See Setting up Permission F&Q](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) for further details.

## Type some words and have fun

The bot should support the **Text Generation** Slash commands `/tg` consisting of three fields:

- `prompt`: text input for the generation
- `output_len`: the length of the text to generate (optional, default: 100)
- `seed`: a random seed between 0 and 65535 (optional, default: random generated seed)

Under the hood, the Discord bot wraps the above Slash command into a HTTP request payload and send the HTTP request to trigger the VDP pipeline `gpt2`.

Now, type some words as the `prompt` and have fun! Write a story or even a poetry and share with your friend 🎉.
