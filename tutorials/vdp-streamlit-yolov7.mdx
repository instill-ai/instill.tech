When YOLOv7 was out, we were so excited to test it out. Therefore, we built a web app to side-by-side compare the classic [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and the freshly released [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). Once completed, we shared the app within our team and then deployed it online to share with the community.

The app was built with two best-in-class machine learning tools:

- [VDP](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) as the backbone of the Computer Vision (CV) task solver, and
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as the application framework to build beautiful UI components.

For anyone who is not familiar with VDP, it is an open-source visual data ETL tool that we've been working on. The goal of VDP is to streamline the end-to-end visual data flow, with the transform component being able to flexibly import models to process the unstructured visual data into structured insights for a specific CV task.

> It is the future for unstructured data ETL, where developers won't need to build their own data connectors, high-maintenance model serving platform or ELT pipeline automation tool.
> — From [Introducing VDP, open-source visual data ETL](https://blog.instill.tech/introducing-vdp/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7)

Streamlit removes the barriers for Data/ML practitioners to build shareable web apps. No need to write HTML, CSS and Javascript to create beautiful UIs, you can just write everything in pure Python.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to replicate the YOLOv4 vs. YOLOv7 web app. It shows that VDP and Streamlit are a perfect match if you work with ML/Data and would like to build Computer Vision prototypes fast to share with your team, clients or the world.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ with an environment-management tool such as [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Build object detection pipelines

:::info{type=info}
[VDP standardises structured outputs for CV Tasks](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core-concepts/cv-task?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7). Therefore, a model is modularised in a pipeline, and model outputs are in standard format for use in data integration or ETL pipeline.
:::

CV Tasks, a.k.a Vision Tasks, focus on analysing and understanding the content of visual data in the same way as the human visual system does. Some classic CV Tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation and keypoint detection. These primitive CV Tasks are the foundation for building many real-world industrial vision applications.

In the following section, we will build two object detection pipelines with YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 in VDP, respectively. The pipelines will serve as the Computer Vision backbone for the Streamlit app.

### Run VDP locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
$ make all
```

Once the services are up, the Console is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build a SYNC object detection pipeline with YOLOv4 via no-code Console

A pipeline in SYNC mode responds to a request synchronously. It is suitable for our Streamlit app to perform real-time inference where low latency is of concern. Check [here](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core-concepts/pipeline?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) for more details.

:::info{type=info}
No matter where your model stores, we want to keep your models in the same place without changes. VDP [integrates with many model platforms and tools](https://www.instill.tech/docs/import-models/overview?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) to make importing models as easy as possible.
:::

After onboarding, you will be redirected to the Pipeline page on the left sidebar, where you can build a `SYNC` pipeline with YOLOv4. Please follow [Build a SYNC classification pipeline](https://www.instill.tech/docs/tutorials/build-a-sync-cls-pipeline?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) with a few alterations:

1. add an `HTTP` source,
2. import a model from GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-yolov4-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov4-dvc) with ID `yolov`
3. deploy a model instance `v1.0-cpu` of the imported model,
4. add an HTTP data destination, and
5. set up a pipeline with ID `yolov4`

### Build a SYNC object detection pipeline with YOLOv7 via low-code

You could build a pipeline with YOLOv7 in the same way by importing [instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc) via no-code Console. Or, you can build it via REST API.

:::info{type=info}
VDP is implemented with [API-first](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core-concepts/overview?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7) design principle. It enables seamless integration to your data stack at any scale.
:::

<CH.Scrollycoding>

You can programmatically build a `SYNC` pipeline via REST API.

```shellscript

curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/v1alpha/source-connectors -d '{
    "id": "source-http",
    "source_connector_definition": "source-connector-definitions/source-http",
    "connector": {
        "configuration": {}
    }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models -d '{
  "id": "yolov7",
  "model_definition": "model-definitions/github",
  "configuration": {
    "repository": "instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc"
  }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1alpha/models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu/deploy

curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/v1alpha/destination-connectors -d '{
  "id": "destination-http",
  "destination_connector_definition": "destination-connector-definitions/destination-http",
  "connector": {
      "configuration": {}
  }
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1alpha/pipelines -d '{
  "id": "yolov7",
  "recipe": {
    "source": "source-connectors/source-http",
    "model_instances": [
      "models/yolov7/instances/v1.0-cpu"
    ],
    "destination": "destination-connectors/destination-http"
  }
}'

```

---

**Step 1**:

Add an HTTP data source

`http://localhost:8082` is the `connector-backend` default URL.

```shellscript focus=1:8

```

---

**Step 2**:

Import a model from the GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc) with ID `yolov7`

```shellscript focus=10:16

```

---

**Step 3**:

Deploy a model instance v1.0-cpu of the imported model

```shellscript focus=18:18

```

---

**Step 4**:

Add a HTTP data destination

```shellscript focus=20:26

```

---

**Step 5**:

Set up a pipeline with ID yolov7

```shellscript focus=27:38

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

Now you should see two pipelines yolov4 and yolov7 in the Console.

In the next section, we will build a Streamlit app to send requests triggering the pipelines and visualise the detection outputs with a beautiful UI.

## Build the app

### Create a Python virtual environment

In this tutorial, we'll use Conda as the package management system. You can install Conda via [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/silent-mode/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#installing-conda-on-a-system-that-has-other-python-installations-or-packages). Using a virtual environment is not required but recommended.

Create and activate an environment named `vdp-streamlit` with Python 3.8:

```bash
conda create --name vdp-streamlit python=3.8
conda activate vdp-streamlit
```

Once activated, you can run scripts from this environment.

### Install app dependencies

Go to /examples/streamlit/yolov7 directory of the VDP project.

```bash
cd examples/streamlit/yolov7
```

The directory of the app will look like the following:

```bash
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── utils.py
```

where `requirements.txt` file contains all the app dependencies. Install all the dependencies required to run the app from the activated virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Trigger the VDP pipelines

In the main app script `main.py`, we use a Streamlit `text.input` to enable user to provide an image URL for inference.

<Gist id="32c999596d6d810182cc8b7e59f63895" />

The pipelines we built are `SYNC` with HTTP connectors, so we create a `trigger_detection_pipeline` function to trigger a pipeline by sending a HTTP request with payload constructed with the provided `image_url`.

<Gist id="26e05e6db00ef4ba41c4f1530170a45b" />

Since the pipeline output is standardised, we also create a `parse_detection_response` function to parse the response into a list of bounding boxes, categories and scores according to the standardised format. Learn more about [standardising object detection task](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core-concepts/cv-task?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-streamlit-yolov7).

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-streamlit-yolov7/cv-task-detection.svg"
  alt="Standardise object detection task in VDP"
/>

<Gist id="57ebe88c43335e962ded50dcbc3cf306" />

In the main function, the input image is sent to trigger both pipelines for a side-by-side comparison.

<Gist id="739e7f0be64ed6be7698747339afa00f" />

### Visualise the detections

Thanks to Steamlit's powerful visualisation features, we create and use functions in `utils.py` to visualise the detections in different ways:

- draw the detections on the input image
- display the detections as `pandas.Dataframe` in an interactive table

<Gist id="fd9fb7f33158b5653a4eb54e064b2e05" />

### Run the app

```bash
$ streamlit run main.py

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.0.10:8501
```

Now go to http://localhost:8501 in the browser and have some fun with your app!

Fill the input field with a random image URL and press **Enter** to see the detection results of YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 side-by-side.
