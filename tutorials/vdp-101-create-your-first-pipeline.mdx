In this tutorial, we are going to build our first ML ETL pipeline with VDP, which allows you to seemlessly run your ML/AI inferences with minimum efforts.

Before we start creating the first pipeline, please ensure you have VDP services runing on your machine. If not, you can setup your own VDP services with the guidelines in the tutorial [VDP 101 - installation].

# Start Your First Pipeline with VDP

If this is your first time setting up VDP, access the VDP Console ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)) and you should see the onboarding page. Please enter your email and you are all set!

As we demonstrated in [VDP 101 - Introduction], VDP aims to streamline the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tasks. It consists of three components:

- `source` - where the pipeline starts to ingest unstructured data to be processed.
- `model instances` - a number of deployed AI models to process the ingested unstructured data in parallel to generate structured outputs.
- `destination` - where to send the structured outputs.

[Can we add the animation example on the homepage here?]

In the following of this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to set up these three comonents and build a `SYNC` object detection pipeline with YOLOv7 via VDP Console. 

## Step 1: Create a New Pipeline

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. Since we have yet setup any pipeline, this page will be empty except. To create our first pipeline via VDP Console, click the **Set up your first pipeline** botton, and we are going start.

## Step 2: Add a HTTP Source

VDP currenly supports two sources, `HTTP` and `gRPC`. A `HTTP` source accepts `HTTP` requests with image payloads to be processed by a pipeline.

> **INFO:** 
> Check our growing list of [Source Connectors](https://www.instill.tech/docs/source-connectors/overview).

To setup a **Source Connector** for ,

1.  click the **Pipeline mode** ▾ drop-down and choose `Sync` (don't worry about this yet, we will talk about this later),
2.  click the **Source type** ▾ drop-down and choose `HTTP`, and
3.  click **Next**.

  alt="Add a HTTP source to set up a SYNC pipeline in the VIP Console."

## Step 3: Import and Deploy a model from GitHub

To process images, here we import a model from our public GitHub repo [instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc).

To set it up,

1.  give your model a unique ID,
2.  add description (optional),
3.  click the **Model source** ▾ drop-down and choose `GitHub`,
4.  fill in the GitHub repository URL `instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc, and
5.  click **Set up** to fetch ML model to VDP.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/create-your-first-pipeline/add-a-model.png"
  alt="Import a model from a GitHub repository via VDP Console."
/>

VDP will fetch all the releases of the GitHub repository. Each release is converted into one model instance, using the release tag as the corresponding model instance ID.

Once the model is imported, we need to the deploy this model on either a `CPU` or `GPU` instance. For simplicity, 

1.  click the **Model instances** ▾ drop-down,
2.  pick `v1.0-cpu`, and
3.  click **Deploy** to deploy it on VDP.

> **NOTE:** you can deploy model on GPU by deploying ML model on `v1.0-gpu`

  alt="Deploy a model instance via VDP Console."

## Step 4: Add a HTTP destination

Since we are building a `SYNC` pipeline, the `HTTP` destination is automatically paired with the `HTTP` source as we setup for the source. So just simply click **Next**.

  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/create-your-first-pipeline/add-a-sync-destination-http.png"
  alt="Add a HTTP destination to create a SYNC pipeline in the VDP Console."
/>

> **NOTE**  
> When creating pipelines under `sync` mode, source and detination connecotrs in VDP must be the same, that means:
> - HTTP source → HTTP destination
> - gRPC source → gRPC destination


## Step 5: Set up the Pipeline

We are almost done! Now we have created `Source`, `Model Instance` and `Destination`. The very last step is to give this pipeline an ID and we are ready to go! Just

1.  give your pipeline a unique ID,
2.  add description (optional), and
3.  click **Set up**.

  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/create-your-first-pipeline/first-pipeline.png"
  alt="Set up a pipeline in the VDP Console."
/>

**CONGRATUATIONS!** You have your first pipeline setup. You should see the pipeline you just created on the **Pipeline** page.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/create-your-first-pipeline/first-pipeline-list.png"
  alt="Find your first pipeline on the Pipeline page."
/>

You can find further details about this pipeline by clicking on the pipeline you just created. The **green** light indicates the pipeline service is `Active` and can be triggered via sending REST requests (HTTP).

You may be aware of the REST examples code that tiggers the pipeline at the bottom of this page. No worry about this now. You will learn how to tigger your piprline in the next tutorial [VDP 101 - How to Tigger a Pipeline].
