In [VDP 101 [1/7] Introduction to VDP](/tutorials/vdp-101-1-introduction), we briefly introduce the high-level concept of VDP.
To benefit a broader community, we release VDP under the open-source Apache license 2.0.
Check it out [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/LICENSE). We've made it easy to get started with VDP on your local machine and Kubernetes (coming soon).

## Prerequisites

Before installing VDP, Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux. It does not currently support Windows, but it is coming soon!
- **Git** - You need Git to download VDP and manage your code.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose to run all services locally.
- **(Optional) NVIDIA Container Toolkit** - To enable GPU support in VDP, this must be installed for Docker to recognise the GPUs.

### Install Git

**Git** is a [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control "Distributed version control") system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers when developing source code. There are many ways to Install Git. Git provides different [installation options](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for all three OS. Use the one you like the most. You can also [install Git via Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

**Docker** is a set of [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service "Platform as a service") (PaaS) products that use [OS-level virtualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization "OS-level virtualisation") to deliver software in packages called [containers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization)> "Container (virtualisation)"). Users won't need to set up their environment before running services.

VDP uses Docker Compose (specifically, `Compose V2` and `Compose specification`) to run all services locally.

Install Docker Desktop:

- [on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) - Be aware of your Mac model. It could come with an **Intel chip** or **Apple silicon**.
- [on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) - Make sure your platform is supported.
- [on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) - VDP does not support Windows yet. Stay tuned!

To enable GPU support in VDP, please refer to the installation guides of the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#install-guide).

## Download and launch VDP

VDP is currently an open-source project maintained on our [Github repository](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp). Don't worry if you are not familiar with it. We have set up everything for you.

Execute the following `bash` commands to start pre-built images with all the dependencies:

```bash
# clone VDP repository to local
$ git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
# start VDP service
$ make all
```

The installation may take a while. Have a cup of tea üçµ. Once the services are up, WHALA, the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

:::info{type=warning}
‚ö†Ô∏é Don't panic if you don't see the Console UI right after `make all`. Downloading the model-backend and Triton Inference Server image will take a while, but it should be a one-time effort.

‚Üì‚Üì You should see the onboarding page. Enter your email, and you are all set! ‚Üì‚Üì

/>

You can also check if VDP is running on your machine by listing the running compose project

```bash
$ docker compose ls --filter name=instill-vdp
NAME            STATUS          CONFIG FILES
instill-vdp     running         < VDP Docker Compose file paths >
```

or by checking whether the `instill-vdp` Docker Compose is running correctly in your **Docker Desktop**.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/2-installation/docker-desktop.png"
  alt='VDP should run as a compose project named as "instill-vdp"'
/>

:::info{type=info}
We highly recommend you allocate at least **32GB** memory to Docker for better stability. Go to `Settings > Resources` of **Docker Desktop** to set it up.

## Shut down VDP

If you don't like what you see and want to **shut down** VDP, please run the `bash` command below:

```bash
# shut down VDP services
$ make down
```

We love to hear your feedback and comments on VDP. Join us in our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh) or create a discussion on [Github](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/discussions).

Okay, now you have VDP running on your machine. Let's create the first pipeline following our next tutorial ‚Üí [VDP 101 [3/7] Create Your First Pipeline on VDP](/tutorials/vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline)
