In this tutorial, we will build our first AI ETL pipeline with VDP, which allows you to run your AI task with minimum effort seamlessly.

Before we start creating the first pipeline, please ensure you have VDP services running on your machine. If not, you can set up your own VDP services with the guidelines in the tutorial [VDP 101 - installation](/tutorials/vdp-101-2-installation).

## Start Your First Pipeline with VDP

If this is your first time setting up VDP, access the VDP Console ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)), and you should see the onboarding page. Enter your email, and you are all set!

As we demonstrated in [VDP 101 - Introduction](/tutorials/vdp-101-1-introduction), VDP aims to streamline the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tasks. It consists of three components:

- `source` - where the pipeline starts to ingest unstructured data to be processed.
- `model instances` - several deployed AI models to process the ingested unstructured data and generate structured outputs.
- `destination` - where to send the structured outputs.

The following tutorial will demonstrate how to set up these three components and build a `SYNC` pipeline for **object detection** with YOLOv7 via VDP Console. 

### Step 1: Create a New Pipeline

Click on the **Pipeline** page on the left sidebar. Since we have not yet set up any pipeline, this page will be empty. To create our first pipeline via VDP Console, click the **Set up your first pipeline** button.

  alt="Empty pipeline list page of the VDP Console."

### Step 2: Add an HTTP Source

VDP currently supports two sources, `HTTP` and `gRPC`. An `HTTP` source accepts `HTTP` requests with image payloads to be processed by a pipeline.

:::info{type=info}
Check our growing list of [Source Connectors](https://www.instill.tech/docs/source-connectors/overview).
:::

To set up a **Source Connector**,

1.  click the **Pipeline mode** ▾ drop-down and choose `Sync`,
2.  click the **Source type** ▾ drop-down and choose `HTTP`, and
3.  click **Next**.

  alt="Add an HTTP source to set up a SYNC pipeline in the VIP Console."
/>


### Step 3: Import and Deploy a model from GitHub

To fulfil objective detection tasks, we import a model from our public GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc).

To set it up,

1.  give your model a unique ID,
2.  add a description (optional),
3.  click the **Model source** ▾ drop-down and choose `GitHub`,
4.  fill in the GitHub repository URL `instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc`, and
5.  click **Set up** to fetch the AI model to VDP.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/3-create-your-first-pipeline/add-a-model.png"
  alt="Import a model from a GitHub repository via VDP Console."
/>

VDP will fetch all the releases of the GitHub repository. Each release is converted into one model instance, using the release tag as the corresponding model instance ID.

Once the model is imported, we need to deploy this model on either a `CPU` or `GPU` instance. For simplicity, 

1.  click the **Model instances** ▾ drop-down,
2.  pick `v1.0-cpu`, and
3.  click **Deploy** to deploy it on VDP.

:::info{type=info}
You can deploy the model on GPU by deploying the AI model on `v1.0-gpu`.

  alt="Deploy a model instance via VDP Console."

### Step 4: Add an HTTP destination

Since we are building a `SYNC` pipeline, the `HTTP` destination is paired automatically with the `HTTP` source as we set up for the source. Click **Next**.

  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/3-create-your-first-pipeline/add-a-sync-destination-http.png"
  alt="Add an HTTP destination to create a SYNC pipeline in the VDP Console."
/>

:::info{type=info}
When creating pipelines under `sync` mode, source and destination connectors in VDP must be the same, which means:
- HTTP source → HTTP destination
- gRPC source → gRPC destination
:::


### Step 5: Set up the Pipeline

We are almost there! We have created `Source`, `Model Instance`, and `Destination`. The last step is to give this pipeline an ID, and we are ready to go! Just

1.  give your pipeline a unique ID,
2.  add a description (optional), and
3.  click **Set up**.

  alt="Set up a pipeline in the VDP Console."

CONGRATULATIONS! You have your first pipeline setup. You should see the pipeline you just created on the **Pipeline** page.

  alt="Find your first pipeline on the Pipeline page."
/>

You can find further details about this pipeline by clicking on the one you just created. The **green** light indicates the pipeline service is `Active` and can be triggered via sending REST requests (HTTP). If anything goes wrong, the pipeline may be in `Inactive`, `Unspecified`, or `Error` status. Further details of this can be found on [pipeline state](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline#state)

  alt="Find further details about this pipeline."
/>

You may notice the REST examples code that triggers the pipeline at the bottom of this page. No worry about this now. You will learn how to trigger this pipeline in the following tutorial → [VDP 101 - How to Tigger a Pipeline](/tutorials/vdp-101-4-how-to-trigger-a-sync-pipeline).
