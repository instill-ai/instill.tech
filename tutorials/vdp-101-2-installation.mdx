In [VDP 101 - 1. Intdocution to VDP](/tutorials/vdp-101-1-introduction), we briefly introduce the high-level concept of VDP. To benefit a broader community, we release VDP under the open-source Apache license 2.0. Check it out [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp/blob/main/LICENSE). We've made it easy to get started with VDP on your local machine and Kubernetes (coming soon). 

## Prerequisites

Before installing VDP, Make sure you have the prerequisites set up: 
- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux. It does not support Windows at the moment but its coming soon!
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose to run all services at local.
- **Git** - well...you need Git to download VDP and manage your code. Make sure you have it. 

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

**Docker** is a set of [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service "Platform as a service") (PaaS) products that use [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization "OS-level virtualization") to deliver software in packages called _[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization) "Container (virtualization)")_. Users won't need to setup their environment before running services.

VDP uses Docker Compose to run all services at local. 

Install Docker Desktop:
- [Install on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) - Be aware of your Mac model. It could come with Intel chip or Apple silicon.
- [Install on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) - Make sure your platform is supported.
- [Install on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) - You can Install Docker Desktop on Windows but is not supported by VDP...... yet ...stay tuned!

### Install Git

**Git** is a [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control "Distributed version control") system: tracking changes in any set of [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file"), usually used for coordinating work among [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") collaboratively developing [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") during [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development").
There are many ways to Install Git. Git provides different [installation options](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for all three OS. Use the one you like the most.You can also [Install Git via Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) if prefered. 


## Download and Install VDP

VDP is currently an open-source project maintained on our [Github repository](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp). Don't worry if you are not familiar with it. We have setup everything for you.

Execute the following `bash` commands to start pre-built images with all the dependencies:

```bash
# move to the folder that you intent to install VDP
cd /<path-of-your-folder>/
# clone VDP repository to local
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
# start VDP service 
make all
```

WHALA! This may take a while. Have a cup of tea. Once the services are up, the Console UI is ready to go at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You should see the onboarding page. Please enter your email and you are all set!

:::info{type=warning}
⚠︎ Don't be panic if you don't see the Console UI right after `make all`. Downloading the Triton server image will take a while, but it should be just a one-time effort.

↓↓ If you see this Console UI, you are ready to go! ↓↓

In some unlikely conditoins, you may wish **shut down** VDP with the `bash` command below:

```bash
# move to the VDP folder
cd /<path-of-your-folder>/vdp
# shut down VDP services 
make down
```

You can also check if VDP is running on your machine by looking at the `instill-vdp` Docker Compose is running correctly in your **Docker Desktop**.

:::info{type=info}
Although not necessary, we highly recommend you give your Docker more memory. Go to `settings > resources` in your **Docker Desktop** app and set memoery to at least **32GB**. You will need to **shut down** and **start** you VDP service after you change your memory setting.

Okay, now you have a VDP running on your machine. Let's create the first pipeline by following our next tutorial → [VDP 101 - 3. Create Your First Pipeline on VDP](/tutorials/vdp-101-3-create-your-first-pipeline)
