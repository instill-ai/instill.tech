A **Pipeline** component is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data. In the previous tutorials, we demonstrated how to use VDP by creating pipelines in `SYNC` mode. However, To fulfil diverse application scenarios, VDP supports three different modes. Depending on the use case, the user can create a pipeline in `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, or `PULL` mode. The combination of the selected source and destination determines the pipeline mode.

In the following of this tutorial, we will explain how these modes work and how to choose the most suitable mode for your ETL pipeline.

## 1. `SYNC` Mode

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously. The result is returned to the user after **model instances** process the data. This mode is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern. The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

  alt="In SYNC mode, VDP responses pipeline trigger requests with task outputs."
/>

The source and destination must be configured with the same protocol type to create a `SYNC` pipeline. VDP supports **HTTP** and **gRPC** for a `SYNC` pipeline.

### When to use the `SYNC` mode

`SYNC` mode provides real-time ETL pipelines where the source and destination are the same. This mode is suitable for coping with smaller data (batches) and AI tasks requiring short inference time. However, it is unsuitable for large data batches and AI models that yield long uploading and inference time.

## 2. `ASYNC` Mode

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs an asynchronous workload. The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response. Once **model instances** have processed the data, the results are sent to the **destination**.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/6-pipeline-modes/async.svg"
  alt="In ASYNC mode, VDP responses pipeline trigger requests with simple ACKs. Task outputs are loaded to destinations defined in the pipelines."
/>

To create an `ASYNC` pipeline, the source can be either HTTP or gRPC, and the destination can be any [Airbyte destination connectors](https://airbyte.com/).

### When to use the `ASYNC` mode

This mode is for use cases that do not require inference results immediately. It is also more suitable when you have limited computational resources for the AI task. This mode allows you to upload data to the pipelines for inferencing, where the processing may occur later.

## 3. `PULL` Mode (coming soon!)

A pipeline in the `PULL` mode performs a scheduled workload to regularly pull data from the **source** to send to **model instances** for inference and write to the **destination**.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/6-pipeline-modes/pull.svg"
  alt="In PULL mode, users trigger pipelines without uploading data. The pipeline will extract data from sources according to its schedule and load AI model inference results to destinations."
/>

### When to use the `PULL` mode

Compared to the `ASYNC` mode, which requires users to trigger the pipeline, the pipelines are triggered by VDP in `PULL` mode. It is, therefore, more suitable for fully automated pipelines where the `PULL` actions can be scheduled according to available computational resources and data generation.
