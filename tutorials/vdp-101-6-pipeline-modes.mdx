A VDP **Pipeline** consists of _Source_, _Model_ and _Destination_, altogether defined in a ` recipe`. One pipeline defines one processing unit for a certain AI task.
It is an end-to-end workflow that automates a sequence of sub-components to process unstructured data.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">

**Pipeline** is the most important concept in VDP. Check the [documentation](/docs/core-concepts/pipeline/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-6-pipeline-modes) for more details.

In the previous tutorials, we demonstrated how to use VDP by creating pipelines in `SYNC` mode. However, To fulfil diverse application scenarios, VDP supports three different modes including `SYNC`, `ASYNC`, and `PULL`.
The combination of selected source and destination determines the pipeline mode.

In the following of this tutorial, we will explain how these modes work and how to choose the most suitable mode for your pipeline.

## `SYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `SYNC` mode responds to a request synchronously. The result is returned to the user after **models** process the data. This mode is for real-time inference where low latency is of concern. The request flow when triggering a `SYNC` pipeline is shown below:

<img

  alt="In SYNC mode, VDP responses pipeline trigger requests with task outputs."
/>

The source and destination must be configured with the same protocol type to create a `SYNC` pipeline. VDP supports **HTTP** and **gRPC** for a `SYNC` pipeline.

`SYNC` mode provides real-time data pipelines. This mode is suitable for coping with stream data to be processed in low latency.

## `ASYNC` mode

A pipeline in the `ASYNC` mode performs an asynchronous workload. The user triggers the pipeline with an asynchronous request and only receives an acknowledged response. Once **models** have processed the data, the results are sent to the **destination**.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/6-pipeline-modes/async.svg"
  alt="In ASYNC mode, VDP responses pipeline trigger requests with simple ACKs. Task outputs are loaded to destinations defined in the pipelines."
/>

To create an `ASYNC` pipeline, the source can be either HTTP or gRPC, and the destination can be any [VDP destination connectors](/docs/core-concepts/connector#destination).

This mode is for use cases that do not require the inference results immediately.

## `PULL` mode (coming soon!)

A pipeline in the `PULL` mode performs a scheduled workload to regularly pull data from the **source** to send to **models** for inference and write to the **destination**.

<img
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-101/6-pipeline-modes/pull.svg"
  alt="In PULL mode, users trigger pipelines without uploading data. The pipeline will extract data from sources according to its schedule and load AI model inference results to destinations."
/>

Compared to the `ASYNC` mode, which requires users to trigger a pipeline via requests, a `PULL` pipeline is automatically triggered based on the configured schedules.
It is, therefore, more suitable for running automated tasks as cron jobs according to computational resources and use cases.

## What's next?

Now that we understand different pipelines modes and their use cases, let's see how to create an `ASYNC` pipeline in our following tutorial → [[7/7] Create, trigger, and parse an ASYNC pipeline](/tutorials/vdp-101-7-create-trigger-parse-an-async-pipeline/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-101-6-pipeline-modes).
