Recently, we announced an exciting partnership with [Numbers Protocol](https://www.numbersprotocol.io), a startup focused on data provenance infrastructure.
For more insights into this revolutionary collaboration, read [Redefining Data Landscapes: Unlocking AI & Blockchain Synergies with Numbers Protocol and Instill AI](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/blog/unlocking-ai-blockchain-synergies).

Starting from v0.11.0-alpha, [Instill VDP](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) introduces the **Blockchain Connector**, a novel feature designed to simplify the integration of third-party blockchain services.
By integrating with Numbers Protocol, this connector enables seamless communication between VDP and the blockchain ecosystem.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use Instill VDP to create a powerful pipeline that integrates AI-generated content with blockchain technology.
By combining [Stability AI](https://stability.ai)'s cutting-edge SDXL text-to-image generation model with Numbers Protocol's service,
the pipeline automatically generates and registers AI-generated data into Web3 assets to ensure data verifiability, traceability, and enhanced security.

## Why AIGC x Web3?

As the prevalence of generative AI continues to increase, an escalation in AI-generated data spread across the internet is inevitable.
The looming issue of misuse is apparent, with these readily generated media disseminating unchecked, and without anyone held accountable for the ensuing consequences.

At Instill AI, we are committed to democratizing AI with ethical considerations in mind.
To safeguard against an unregulated future in the AI and data industry, it is crucial to take proactive measures.
Integrating AI-generated or AI-assisted content with blockchain technology provides transparency, trust, and an immutable record.
This combination ensures a secure and traceable lineage of content, allowing us to maintain an unblemished content history.

Let's dive into the tutorial and start building this powerful AIGC x Web3 pipeline!

## Preparation

You have two options to access Instill VDP: via the cloud platform Instill Cloud or by self-hosting Instill Core.
For more information on each option, please refer to the documentation [here](https://www.instill.tech/docs/instill-cloud/welcome/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol).

### Access Instill VDP via Instill Cloud (Recommended)

[Instill Cloud](https://console.instill.tech/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol) is the recommended method for accessing Instill VDP, offering ease of use and reliability.
To get started, all you need is an Instill Cloud account. Follow these steps to [set up your Instill Cloud account and log in to the Instill Cloud Console](https://www.instill.tech/docs/instill-cloud/getting-started/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol).

### Run Instill VDP via Instill Core locally

Alternatively, if you prefer to access Instill VDP by self-hosting Instill Core, please make sure that you have installed the following tools:

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows yet.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose (specifically, `Compose V2` and Compose specification) to run all services at local. Please install the latest stable [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before using VDP.
- `yq` > `v4.x`. Please follow the installation [guide](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install).

Open your terminal and run the following commands to set up Instill VDP with Docker Compose:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
make all
```

Once all the services are up, access the no-code Console at http://localhost:3000.

With these options, you can conveniently access Instill VDP according to your preference - via the user-friendly Instill Cloud or by self-hosting Instill Core on your local system.

## Build the pipeline

We will guide you through the process of building a VDP pipeline, focusing on a basic generative pipeline.
To accomplish this, we will be using the **Stability AI AI Connector**, which seamlessly integrates with Stability AI's services,
and the **Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector** to convert data into Web3 assets.

After onboarding, you will be redirected to the **Pipeline** page.
If you haven't set up any pipelines yet, the page will be empty.
To create a pipeline through the Console, click on **Add new pipeline**. This will redirect you to the _no-code pipeline builder_.
On the canvas, you can drag and drop connectors and operators to construct your pipeline.

### Step 1/4: Set up a Start Operator and an End Operator

The Start Operator serves as the initial point of the VDP pipeline, while the End Operator is used at the pipeline's end to receive the output as a response when triggering the pipeline.
To set up the Start and End Operators:

1. On the no-code pipeline builder, click **Operator** on the left sidebar and drag **Start** Operator into the canvas
2. Click **Create** on the right panel to create the Start Operator
3. Click **Operator** on the left again and drag **End** Operator into the canvas
4. Click **Create** on the right panel to create the End Operator

### Step 2/4: Set up a Stability AI AI Connector

**Use a pre-created connector on Instill Cloud**

Instill Cloud offers a list of public AI Connectors, which are ready to use, eliminating the need to create accounts for third-party AI services.

For this example, click **AI** on the left sidebar and drag the pre-created Stability AI AI Connector with ID **instill-stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v0-9** into the canvas.
This connector is linked to the [Stable Diffusion XL 0.9](https://stability.ai/blog/sdxl-09-stable-diffusion) model,
capable of generating hyper-realistic creations for films, television, music, and instructional videos, as well as offering advancements for design and industrial use.

**Setup from scratch**

Optionally, if you are using Instill Core or prefer to use different models from Stability AI, you can set up a Stability AI account by visiting [dreamstudio.ai](https://dreamstudio.ai).
Then, proceed to create a Stability AI AI Connector on the Console from scratch by following the guidelines [here](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/ai-connectors/stability-ai/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol).

1. Click **AI** on the left and drag **Stability AI** under the Popular Presets into the canvas
2. Fill in the following information on the right panel

   - Fill **API Key**. Following the Stability AI [documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication) to find your API key
   - Click **Task** ▾ drop-down and choose **Text to Image**
   - Click **Engine** ▾ drop-down and choose the AI model you want to use. check [here](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/features/api-parameters#engine) to get the model details. Let's use the same model **stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v0-9** (Stable Diffusion XL 0.9) as above
   - A randomly unique ID is assigned to the connector, which you can modify to your preferred ID

3. Click on the **Create** button and then **Connect** to utilize the connector

### Step 3/4: Set up a Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector

**Use a pre-created connector on Instill Cloud**

Similar to the previous connector, Instill Cloud provides a Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector that is readily available for all users.

Click **Blockchain** on the left sidebar and drag the pre-created Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector with ID **instill-number** into the canvas.
This connector ensures your data file will be pinned on the IPFS network with on-chain records through the [Numbers Gateway](https://ipfs-pin.numbersprotocol.io/ipfs/), ensuring permanent storage.

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  Rest assured, if you are hesitant about using the pre-created shared Numbers
  Protocol Blockchain Connector to register your assets, we have good news. In
  the near future, a transfer API will be introduced, enabling the smooth
  transfer of all Web3 assets to your Capture Account. If you prefer not to
  register your data under our shared account, please refer to the following
  section for alternative options.
</InfoBlock>

**Setup from scratch**

Optionally, if you are using Instill Core or you want to register the AI-generated content under your personal account, you'll first need to create a [Capture Account](https://captureapp.xyz/).
Then, you can set up a Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector from scratch by following the [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/blockchain-connectors/numbers-protocol/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol):

1. Click **Blockchain** on the left sidebar and drag **Numbers** under Popular Presets into the canvas
2. Fill in the following information on the right panel

   - Fill **Capture token**. Follow the Capture App [documentation](https://docs.captureapp.xyz/about-capture/capture-account-and-wallet/capture-token) to acquire your capture token
   - Click **Asset type** ▾ drop-down and choose **images**
   - Toggle **'texts' input as asset metadata** to `true`. This will link to the `texts` output of another component and upload the `texts` data to the blockchain as part of the asset metadata
   - Toggle **'structured_data' input as asset metadata** to `false`
   - Toggle **'metadata' input as asset metadata** to `true`. This will link the `metadata` output of another component, the upload the `metadata` to the blockchain as part of the asset metadata

3. Click on the **Create** button and then **Connect** to utilize the connector

### Step 4/4: Construct a pipeline

Almost there! The final step is to link the components to control the data flow in a fine-grained manner, and your pipeline will be ready to go:

1. Link the components

   - Connect the `texts` and `metadata` outputs of Start Operator with the corresponding inputs of the Stability AI AI Connector and the Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector
   - Connect the `images` output of the Stability AI AI Connector to the corresponding input of the Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector and the End Operator
   - Connect the `metadata` output of the Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector to the corresponding input of the End Operator

2. The pipeline will be assigned a randomly generated unique ID, which you can change on the right panel, for example, **aigc-web3**. Optionally, you can add a description
3. Finally, click **Create** on the bottom to create the pipeline, and then click **Activate** to activate it

## Trigger the pipeline to generate and register AI-generated content into Web3 asset

VDP automatically generates a dedicated endpoint for each pipeline to process your data. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to trigger the pipeline and create your Web3 asset.

Start by clicking on the right panel to reveal the **Pipeline Properties**. This will show you the necessary details to trigger the pipeline.

### Create an API token (only for Instill Cloud users)

If you are using Instill Core, you can skip this step as an API token is not required.
However, for Instill Cloud users, you will need a valid API token to trigger the pipeline.

To create an API token, follow these steps:

1. Click **Settings** ⚙️ on the top sidebar
2. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page
3. Just give it an ID and click **Create Token**
4. The API token will be generated and displayed in the table. Keep this token safe as it does not expire.

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">
  If your token is compromised, choose that token and click Delete. But be
  cautious, as this action is irreversible and will stop all apps using this
  token.
