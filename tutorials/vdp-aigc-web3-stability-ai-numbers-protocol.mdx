Recently, we announced an exciting partnership with [Numbers Protocol](https://www.numbersprotocol.io), a startup focused on data provenance infrastructure.
For more insights into this revolutionary collaboration, read [Redefining Data Landscapes: Unlocking AI & Blockchain Synergies with Numbers Protocol and Instill AI](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/blog/unlocking-ai-blockchain-synergies).

Starting from v0.11.0-alpha, [Instill VDP](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core) introduces the **Numbers Protocol Connector**.
By integrating with Numbers Protocol blockchain service, this connector enables seamless communication between VDP and the blockchain ecosystem.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use Instill VDP to create a powerful pipeline that integrates AI-generated content with blockchain technology.
By combining [Stability AI](https://stability.ai)'s cutting-edge SDXL text-to-image generation model with Numbers Protocol's service,
the pipeline automatically generates and registers AI-generated data into Web3 assets to ensure data verifiability, traceability, and enhanced security.

## Why AIGC x Web3?

As the prevalence of generative AI continues to increase, an escalation in AI-generated data spread across the internet is inevitable.
The looming issue of misuse is apparent, with these readily generated media disseminating unchecked, and without anyone held accountable for the ensuing consequences.

At Instill AI, we are committed to democratizing AI with ethical considerations in mind.
To safeguard against an unregulated future in the AI and data industry, it is crucial to take proactive measures.
Integrating AI-generated or AI-assisted content with blockchain technology provides transparency, trust, and an immutable record.
This combination ensures a secure and traceable lineage of content, allowing us to maintain an unblemished content history.

Let's dive into the tutorial and start building this powerful AIGC x Web3 pipeline!

## Preparation

You have two options to access Instill VDP: via the cloud platform Instill Cloud or by self-hosting Instill Core.
For more information on each option, please refer to the documentation [here](/docs/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol).

### Access Instill VDP via Instill Cloud (Recommended)

[Instill Cloud](https://www.instill.tech/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol) is the recommended method for accessing Instill VDP, offering ease of use and reliability.
To get started, all you need is an Instill Cloud account. Follow these steps to [set up your Instill Cloud account and log in to the Instill Cloud Console](/docs/latest/quickstart/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=vdp-aigc-web3-stability-ai-numbers-protocol).

### Run Instill VDP via Instill Core locally

Alternatively, if you prefer to access Instill VDP by self-hosting Instill Core, please make sure that you have installed the following tools:

- **macOS or Linux** - VDP works on macOS or Linux, but does not support Windows yet.
- **Docker and Docker Compose** - VDP uses Docker Compose (specifically, `Compose V2` and Compose specification) to run all services at local. Please install the latest stable [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before using VDP.
- `yq` > `v4.x`. Please follow the installation [guide](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install).

Open your terminal and run the following commands to set up Instill VDP with Docker Compose:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core.git && cd instill-core
make all
```

Once all the services are up, access the no-code Console at http://localhost:3000.

With these options, you can conveniently access Instill VDP according to your preference - via the user-friendly Instill Cloud or by self-hosting Instill Core on your local system.

## Build the pipeline using no-code method

We will guide you through the process of building a VDP pipeline, focusing on a basic generative pipeline using no-code method. To accomplish this, we will be using the **Stability AI AI Connector**, which seamlessly integrates with Stability AI's services, and the **Numbers Protocol Blockchain Connector** to convert data into Web3 assets.

### Step 0/4: Create a new Pipeline

After onboarding, you will be redirected to the **Pipeline** page. If you haven't set up any pipelines yet, the page will be empty. To create a pipeline with template through the Console, click on `Turn your AI art into Web3 asset` . This will redirect you to the no-code pipeline builder with several nodes shown in the beginning.

### Create an API token (only for Instill Cloud users)

If you are using Instill Core, you can skip this step as an API token is not required.
However, for Instill Cloud users, you will need a valid API token to trigger the pipeline.

To create an API token, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[homepage](https://www.instill.tech/)** of the console.
1. Click **Settings** ⚙️ on the bottom-left
1. Navigate to the **API Tokens** page
1. Just give it an ID and click **Create Token**
1. The API token will be generated and displayed in the table. Keep this token safe as it does not expire.

<InfoBlock type="tip" title="tip">
  If your token is compromised, choose that token and click Delete. But be
  cautious, as this action is irreversible and will stop all apps using this
  token.
</InfoBlock>

### Trigger the pipeline

To trigger the pipeline, you can use cURL with the provided API token as a Bearer token in the authorization headers (required only for Instill Cloud). Here's an example of how to do it:

```shellscript Trigger-via-Instill-Cloud
curl -X POST 'https://api.instill.tech/vdp/v1alpha/users/shihchun-h/pipelines/aigc-web3/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
--data  '{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"asset_creator": "Hi",
			"prompts": [
				"Super Cute Combat"
			]
		}
	]
}'
```

```shellscript Trigger-via-Instill-Core
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/v1alpha/pipelines/aigc-web3/trigger' \
--data  '{
	"inputs": [
		{
			"asset_creator": "Hi",
			"prompts": [
				"Super Cute Combat"
			]
		}
	]
}'
```

<InfoBlock type="info" title="info">
  To understand the Numbers Protocol related parameters in the `metadata` field,
  including details about the asset creator and license, you can refer to the
  [documentation](/docs/latest/vdp/connectors/numbers-protocol) for
  comprehensive information.
</InfoBlock>

Please be patient as the request may take a a dozen seconds to process. Once completed, you will receive a response.

```shellscript
{"outputs":[
  {"asset_urls":["https://nftsearch.site/asset-profile?cid=bafybeif32uuelkrzrt33lbxmu4ws6hm6n5sbr4h57aekhygof35tb5qzhe"],
  "images":["iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."]}
  ]
}
```

The generated assets can be easily accessed and explored using the [Numbers Search Engine](https://nftsearch.site/).
To view the Web3 asset created above, navigate to the [link](https://nftsearch.site/asset-profile?cid=bafybeigsm77s5f4guckxvrjyo255fac53two66tcbmebw37oxufv7ipaia) in `asset_urls`.
