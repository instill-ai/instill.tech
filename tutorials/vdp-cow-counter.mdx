## Herd cattle with drones?

In the recent documentary series _Clarkson's Farm (2021)_, Jeremy Clarkson took us on his journey and showed us how he herded sheep with a barking drone successfully - or maybe not ü§£.

<Tweet tweetId="1400027716573872128" />

Joking aside, apparently [sheep can follow drone pretty well with the right training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1ZuYjsUZU&t=19s) and [using drones emitting certain sounds was able to reduce the stress on the sheep](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/newsroom/news/sky-shepherding-using-drones-ethically-herd-sheep).

Over the last few years, drone-based smart agriculture solutions have become increasingly popular due to numerous benefits, including deeper insights into farming assets and data-driven decision-making process for better efficiency and reduced operational cost.

To explain the solutions on a high level, it usually includes the following processes:

- Deploy drones and sensors to collect livestock data
- Use AI technology to process and analyse the data for locating, counting or monitoring cattle
- Provide easy-to-understand insights and takeaways to enable ranchers to make data-driven decisions or take immediate actions when issues arise

To showcase the above processes, read on or watch our video to see how to build an object detection ETL pipeline using [VDP](http://go.instill.tech/4en2fm) to analyse a drone video of a cattle farm, and create a Cow Counter dashboard with [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) that provides insights about cattle in the video footage.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker compose
- Python 3.8+ with an environment-management tool such [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Build an object detection ETL data pipeline

In the [Build a shareable object detection application with VDP and Streamlit](https://www.instill.tech/tutorials/vdp-streamlit-yolov7/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cow-counter) tutorial, we built a `SYNC` object detection pipeline that responds to HTTP requests synchronously with VDP. This time, we are going to use the same model YOLOv7 to build an object detection pipeline but in `ASYNC` mode. Unlike a `SYNC` pipeline, this pipeline

- accepts HTTP requests with image payload,
- transforms the images in the payload into structured insights, and
- sends the structured insights into a PostgreSQL database.

<CtaButton text="‚≠êÔ∏è Star VDP on GitHub" link="http://go.instill.tech/4en2fm" />

### Run VDP locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp.git && cd vdp
make all
```

Once all the services are up, go to the Console at http://localhost:3000.

### Build an ASYNC data pipeline with YOLOv7

After onboarding, you will be redirected to the **Pipeline** page. Please follow the steps of [Build an ASYNC detection pipeline](https://www.instill.tech/docs/tutorials/build-an-async-det-pipeline?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cow-counter).

1. add a HTTP source,
2. import a model from GitHub repository [instill-ai/model-yolov7](https://github.com/instill-ai/model-yolov7-dvc) with ID `yolov7`,
3. deploy a model instance `v1.0-cpu` of the imported model,
4. add a PostgreSQL destination, with ID `postgres-db`,
5. set up a pipeline with ID `detection`.

Alternatively, you could refer to the [low-code example](https://www.instill.tech/docs/tutorials/build-an-async-det-pipeline?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cow-counter#build-via-low-code) to build this pipeline programmatically via REST API.

Now you should see the pipeline `detection` in the Console.

### Trigger the pipeline to analyse a drone video

#### Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

We'll use Conda as the package management system like we did it in the last [tutorial](https://www.instill.tech/tutorials/vdp-streamlit-yolov7/?utm_source=tutorial&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cow-counter).

First, create and activate an environment named `vdp-dashboard` with Python 3.8:

```bash
conda create --name vdp-streamlit python=3.8
conda activate vdp-dashboard
```

Then, go to [/examples/async/yolov7](http://go.instill.tech/4gz2am) directory of the VDP project to install all dependencies.

```bash
cd examples/async/yolov7
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Trigger the pipeline

The directory of the project should look like the following

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile-metabase-m1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py
```

To run the demo for processing the video, we simply do

```bash
python main.py
```

You could skip to the next section to create the dashboard. But if you're interested, here we dive into the demo details.

First, the script will download a 1-minute drone video of a cattle farm `cows_dornick.mp4` from a public Google storage bucket.

<Gist id="3617e049a20510117096d0ca6ee12989" />

:::info{type=info}
The video used in the demo is sampled from a public video `cows dornick.mp4` from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YFDJRO).
:::

<Youtube id="bIQF2O3Z_xU" />

After finishing downloading the video, `extract_frames_from_video` function will extract frames from the video into a folder `inputs` at 30 frames per second.

<Gist id="e16fbb1cc834f07303bb7982c0776306" />

Then, we trigger the pipeline `detection` to analyse the video by sending HTTP requests to process all frames in the `input` folder.

<Gist id="9a471f07c1b897ce1820552bebfab696" />

Each triggering pipeline operation will send the analysed result to the configured PostgreSQL database and return a list of unique indexes corresponding to all processed image frames in the payload.

It may take a while to analyse the full video. Meanwhile, we can connect to the Postgres database to check whether it is working as expected. You should see the tutorial database is already populated with some data üöÄ.

<Gist id="613ebf6cb10e7677d877653882f55ecf" />

In the next section, we will setup Metabase to connect to the data in the destination PostgreSQL database and build a dashboard based on the analysis results.

## Create a Cow Counter dashboard

Metabase is an open-source business intelligence (BI) tool that helps you uncover the data insights like an analyst. Just connect to your database, you can dig deeper into your data, easily build interactive dashboards and share them with stakeholders.

### Run Metabase locally

In this tutorial, we [run Metabase on Docker](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-metabase-on-docker). If you prefer, check out [alternative ways](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/installing-metabase) to install Metabase.

```bash
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest
docker run -d -p 3100:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

Note: If the official Metabase docker image doesn't work on M1 (apple silicon) mac, try to build an image with the `Dockerfile-metabase-m1` file.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-metabase-m1 -t metabase/metabase-m1 .
docker run -d -p 3100:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase-m1
```

Once the Metabase startup completes, you can access it at http://localhost:3100.

### Create the dashboard

During onboarding, add your PostgreSQL database.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-cow-counter/add-your-data.png"
  alt="Add your PostgreSQL database during Metabase onboarding"
/>

Then, click **Browse data** on the left sidebar, choose **vdp-postgres ‚ûù Airbyte Raw Vdp**:

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-cow-counter/browse-data.png"
  alt="Browse data in the PostgreSQL database"
/>

As you can see, the pipeline outputs are stored in the `Airbyte Data ‚ûù Detection ‚ûù Objects` field with JSON blob format.

#### Convert raw detections into multiple records

To flatten the raw detections (JSON blob) into multiple records for further analysis, Click **+New** on the top right corner, choose **SQL query ‚ûù Select a database** vdp-postgres, then copy and paste the following SQL query and press **Run query**:

<Gist id="25359a77c905c2289a5057a2f2d583f0" />

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-cow-counter/transform-json-blob-to-records.png"
  alt="Convert raw detections in the database into multiple records for future analysis"
/>

The transformed data counts every time a cow appeared in the video footage.

### Visualise the data

Click on **Visualization** to open the visualization sidebar and choose **Area**. For **Data** tab, select the fields `processed_at` and `category` for **X-axis**, and select the field `Count` for **Y-axis**. You can customise the area chart as you want. Here we just enabled **Show values on data points** in the **Display** tab.

:::info{type=info}
Metabase has a hard limitation 2,000 to the number of rows displayed for a table. Therefore, the dashboard won't show all the detections.
:::

To make the dashboard accessible, you can save this question into the **Our analytics** collection by clicking **Save** on the top right and give it a name cow counter.

<ZoomableImg
  src="/tutorial-assets/vdp-cow-counter/save-question.png"
  alt="Visualise video analysis results on Metabase"
/>

üéâ Congrats! You've built a simple yet intuitive dashboard to count cows in a drone video footage. To validate the dashboard, the demo script `main.py` also generates a video `output.mp4` with detections drawn on frames by the end of the demo.

<Youtube id="jokydabr70M" />

We use [YOLOv7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696) in the ETL pipeline, since it is the state-of-the-art object detector that surpasses all known ones in both speed and accuracy. The above video showed that it worked fairly well considering it was only trained on the public [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org) without any fine-tuning.

### Limitation

However, if you want to improve the performance, as you can spot that some cows were wrongly detected as "dogs" on a few frames, it is highly recommended to fine-tune the model on labelled drone data collected from the same domain.

<ZoomableImg
